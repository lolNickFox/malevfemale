ABSTRACT
This article presents the results of a comparativestudy of two Hispanic communitiesin New YorkCity:WashingtonHeightsandElmhurst/Corona. Our data on language proficiency, language use, and attitudes were gatheredusing a sociolinguistic questionnaire.However, the study benefited from the interactiveprocess established between the researchersand the communitieswhich they studied and in which they live and work.
Ourdataareanalyzedalongthreedimensions. First, we comparedatafor the two Spanish-speakingcommunities. We discuss how the social status and the ethnic configurationof the community affect linguistic and attitudinalbehaviors.Then, we analyzethe dataaccordingto nationalorigin. We discuss how the five nationalitygroupsincludedin our study - Central Americans,Cubans, Dominicans, PuertoRicans, and South Americans differ in languageproficiency, languageuse, andlanguageattitudes.Finally, we comparethe data for Dominicansin WashingtonHeights to that of Dominicansin Elmhurst/Corona.We examine how nationalorigin and the languagesurroundof the ethnic community interactin orderto determine languageuse andattitudes.Some of the findingshere differ from what may be supposedof such cases.
We suggest socioeducationaland language policies for Hispanics in the UnitedStatesbasedon the resultsof this study.

with the largestpopulationsand the longest historyof settlementin the United States, namely Mexican-Americansin the Southwest and elsewhere (Aguirre I982, I985; Amastae I982; Ellas-Olivares1976; Sanchez 1983), PuertoRicans in New York City (Attinasi 1979; Centro de Estudios PuertormquefiosI982; Pedraza1987; Zentella 198I), and Cuban-Americansin Dade County, Florida (Otheguy& GarciaI988; Sole I980). The use of Spanishby these Latinogroups is often influencedby the attitudesand behaviorof the Anglo society towards Spanishin the United States. However, more recent immigrationfrom Central andSouthAmericasandthe DominicanRepublichas hadan even greaterimpact on the use of Spanish and the attitudestowardSpanish of all Hispanics in the United States. Yet, these more recently arrivedLatino groups remain largely ignoredin the sociolinguistic literature.
This articlepresentsthe resultsof a comparativesociolinguistic study of two Hispaniccommunitiesin New York City thatare characterizedby an unusually large number of more recent Hispanic immigrants and a remarkablysmall numberof PuertoRicanresidents,the most numerousHispanicgroupin the city. Fishman(I971) studiedthe bilingualismof PuertoRicanresidentsin the Greater New Yorkarea. Extensive Spanishlanguageuse and attitudinalresearchamong Puerto Ricans in East Harlemhas been conducted by the Centro de Estudios Puertorriquefios(I982, I988) and others associated with the Centro (Attinasi 1979; Pedraza I987). Our study extends their findings to WashingtonHeights and Elmhurst/Corona,communities in which Spanish is widely used, mostly among non-PuertoRicans.
Three main researchquestions guided our study: I. How do languageproficiency, Spanishlanguageuse, andattitudediffer in two distinct Hispaniccommunitiesin the United States?How do they relateto the socioeconomic statusof the communityandto its ethnicconfiguration?That is, is Spanish used more or less and favored more or less by a middle-class Hispaniccommunitythanby a poor Hispaniccommunity?Is Spanishused more or less andfavoredmoreor less in anethniccommunitythatis mostlycomposed of one nationalorigin or of mixed Hispanicorigin? 2. How do language proficiency, Spanish language use, and attitudediffer among distinct Hispanicnationalorigin groups? 3. Concerninglanguageproficiency, Spanishlanguageuse, and attitude,are Hispanicsbettercategorizedaccording to geographicalcommunityor national origin? Ourresearchteamconsistedof one facultymemberandfourgraduatestudents of the Bilingual CommunityEducationProgramof The City College of New York. All of the researcherslive or work in one of the two Hispanic communities. Two are Dominicans, two are Cubans, and one is South American. A sociolinguistic questionnairefocusing on language proficiency, language use, and languageattitudewas designed. The questionnairewas writtenin Spanish and English. To administerthe questionnaires,an interactiveprocedurewas

followed in which the researchersinterviewed the respondents. We planned, then, to obtain clear answers on a self-reportmeasureof language proficiency and language use, as well as to observe the actual language behavior of the respondents.
Duringthreemonthsof intensive work at the intersectionof i8oth Streetand Broadwayin WashingtonHeights and the intersectionof Roosevelt Avenue and JunctionBoulevardin Elmhurst,a total of 294 residents(i i8 from Washington Heights and 176 from Elmhurst/Corona)were interviewed, chosen by convenience. The only criteriafor inclusion in the study were that they be Hispanics and reside within the geographicalboundariesof WashingtonHeights and Elmhurst/Coronaoutlined below.
The two speech communitiesthat we studiedare similaronly in theirintense and vital use of Spanish. However, we suspect that the Hispanic residents of Washington Heights are mostly poor, whereas Hispanic residents of Elmhurst/Coronaaremoremiddleclass. The ethnicconfigurationof the two communities also seem very different. Whereas Washington Heights has a predominance of Dominicans, Elmhurst/Coronahas a mixture of South and Central Americans, Cubans, Dominicans, and PuertoRicans.
It was our intent that the data gatheredon language proficiency, use, and attitudebe used to establishlanguageandsocioeducationalpolicies in community agencies where the researchersworked as volunteers.
THE TWO COMMUNITIES
WashingtonHeights and ElmhurstICorona WashingtonHeights is located in the northernpartof Manhattan.It extends in a trianglefrom 155thStreeton the south and the HudsonRiveron the west to the HarlemRiver on the northand east.
WashingtonHeights was, until the I960s, a middle-class community with mostly IrishandJewish residents. In the I960s the white middle class startedto flee the city toward the suburbs. Working-classand poor people, first Puerto Ricans, then Cubans,and morerecentlyDominicans, startedtakingthe place of the white middle class (CommunityProfile 12, I983; Georges I984).
The populationof Washington Heights today is 54 percent Hispanic. This figure does not include the many undocumentedpersons who are found in the area. While the Hispanicpopulationhas increasedby 85 percentsince 1970, the white populationhas decreased by 44 percent. The ethnic groups that used to occupy a predominantplace priorto ig6o have almost completely disappeared, although7 percentof the populationis still Irish, whereas another7 percentis German(CommunityProfile 12, I983; Georges I984).
The Hispanic group that predominatesis, without a doubt, the Dominican. The I980 Census counted 27,577 Dominicans in WashingtonHeights. Cubans

(5,305 residents) and Ecuadorians(I,39I residents) make up the two other largest Hispanic groups in the area (Community Profile I2, I983; Georges I984). Approximately8o percent of the Hispanic population of Washington
Heights is of Dominicanorigin. Today the average salary in Washington Heights is $I5,281. Twenty-one
percentof the familiesareon welfare, and9 percentareunemployed.The rateof birthin WashingtonHeightsis 3I percenthigherthanthe generalratein the City of New York, and from 1970 to I980 it increasedby 23 percent. Schools are overpopulatedand there is a serious housing shortage(CommunityProfile 12,
I983; Georges 1984). In Washington Heights most of the Hispanic businesses are Dominican
bodegasandCubanrestaurantsT. herearemanyDominicancommunityagencies thatfightfor the rightsof the Dominicansin the area.Inparticular,la Asociaci6n Comunalde DominicanosProgresistasprovidesmanyeducational,housing, and legal services to the community(FermnndezI984).
Elmhurst/Coronais in the countyof Queens. It extends fromthe Long Island Expresswayin the southto Roosevelt Avenue in the northand from 72nd Street in the west to II4th Streetin the east. We also includedin this studythe areathat goes from Roosevelt Avenue to NorthernBoulevardin the northand from 96th Streetor JunctionBoulevardto I14th Street in the east. This section is usually
referredto as North Corona. The areas of Elmhurstand North Corona in Queens are very different from
WashingtonHeights. In the 1960s many Italianand Irish middle-class families still owned one-family homes built before World War11and subsidizedby the govemment. AfterWorldWar1Iapartmentbuildingsstartedto go up in Queens. These buildings attractedmany middle-classHispanicsin the I960s. However, in I960 the zoning law was changedandconstructionof multipleunitbuildings was stopped. The two- andthree-familyhomes thatwere builtafter I960 started to attracta greatnumberof Asians who hadthe financialresourcesnecessaryto buy these homes (CommunityBoardNo. 4 Portfolio I984).
Accordingto the I980 Census, the populationtodayis 38 percentHispanic,34 percentWhite, 1o percentBlack, 15 percentAsian (includingChinese, Koreans, Filipinos, and Indians),and 3 percentthatwere classified as belongingto other ethnic groups. In Elmhurst/Coronaone finds the largestconcentrationof legal and illegal immigrants in New York City coming from some II0 different countries (Blum 1979; Kleiman I982).
The change of populationbetween I970 and 1980 in Elmhurst/Coronahas been very different from that of WashingtonHeights. Accordinlgto the I980 Census, the Hispanic group has increasedby 68 percent, comparedto the 85 percentincreaseof the Hispanicpopulationin WashingtonHeights. The greatest demographicchange in the area can be observed among the Blacks, Orientals, and those that have been classified as belonging to otherethnic groups. Blacks have increasedby 195 percent. It is estimatedthat the Asian groups and those

classifiedas othershave increased300 percentin the last ten years. However, the increasein these minorities,for the most partmiddleclass andeducated,has not spurredthe flight of the white population,which in the last decade decreasedby only 3 percent.It is estimatedthatthe white populationwill show an increasein the I990 census due to the increased cost of living in Manhattan. Elmhurst/Coronaoffers proximityto the city, low rents, and a multiethniccharacter with middle-classdistinctiveness.
The multiethnicityof Elmhurst/Coronais also reflected in the varietyof Hispanic groupsresidingin the area. Colombians, Ecuadorians,Peruvians,Argentines, Dominicans,Cubans,PuertoRicans, and manyotherslive side by side. It would be difficult to determinewhich Hispanic national origin predominates. However,SouthAmericansclearlymakeup the majorityof the Hispanicpopulation west of JunctionBoulevard, whereas Dominicans predominateeast of it.
The I980 Census revealed that the average salary is $I9,601 and only 6 percentof the populationis on welfare. Ethnicbusinessesof all kindsproliferate. Hispanicbusinesses are diversified. One finds many Colombian and Peruvian restaurantsE; cuadoriantravelagencies;Cubanprintingpresses, furnitureshops, andjewelry shops; Argentinebutchershops and bakeries;Dominican bodegas. In contrastto WashingtonHeights and perhapsbecause of its diversified Hispanic national origin, there is little social organization among Hispanics in Elmhurst/CoronaF. orexample, therearefew Hispaniccommunityagencies that providecomprehensiveservices to the community.
From our observation as well as from the figures derived from the I980 Census, we can conclude thattherearetwo maincharacteristicsthatdistinguish Elmhurst/Coronafrom WashingtonHeights:
I. Social class. Hispanics in Elmhurst/Coronaare more middle class than Hispanicsin WashingtonHeights.
2. Ethnic configuration. Hispanics in Elmhurst/Coronalive among many otherethnolinguisticminorities,whereasin WashingtonHeightsthey arethe sole ethnolinguistic minority. Furthermore,Hispanics in Elmhurst/Coronacome frommanynationaloriginsandlack social cohesiveness, whereasthose in Washington Heights are mostly Dominicans and have a greater degree of social cohesiveness.
Demographic characteristicsof the sample in the two communities
Our sample has characteristicsthat coincide with those of the 1980 Census for the two communitiesthat we studied (see Table I). Over three-fourthsof our WashingtonHeightssampleis Dominican.The restof the sampleis madeupof a greaternumberof South AmericansandCubansanda smallernumberof Puerto Ricans and CentralAmericans.The sample for Elmhurst/Coronais much more variedaccordingto nationalorigin. Approximatelyone-thirdis SouthAmerican, one-thirdis Cuban,andone-thirdis madeup of Dominicans,CentralAmericans, and a smallernumberof PuertoRicans.

As shown in Table i, almost half of the WashingtonHeightspopulationhas lived in the United States for less than five years, making this a much more recently arrived population than that of Elmhurst/Corona.The Washington Heights population is also younger and less educated than that of Elmhurst/Corona. Twenty-eight percent of those we interviewed in Washington Heights, compared to only I percent in Elmhurst/Corona,have not finished elementary school.
In both WashingtonHeights andElmhurst/Corona,Hispanicsare mostly employed as blue collar workers.Studentand housewifearethe second most common occupationalcategories in both communities. The main occupationaldifference between the two communities is in the categories of unemployed,

professional, business owner, and office worker.The WashingtonHeights sample has twelve times the number of unemployed people (I2 percent) as the Elmhurstsample (i percent). The Elmhurst/Coronasample has four times the numberof office workers,threetimes the numberof professionals,andtwice the numberof business owners as the WashingtonHeights sample.
Linguisticproficiency in the two communities
As shown in Table 2, when askedwhetherthey spoke Spanishwell or not well, IOOpercentof those we interviewedindicatedthatthey spoke Spanishwell. The vitality of Spanish in both communities was also confirmed when only nine people out of the 294 who were interviewedpreferredto answerin English. The other97 percentansweredourquestionsin whatwe judgedto be fluentSpanish, although obviously influenced by English. This English influence that preoccupies so many Spanish language professionals was of no concern to our respondents. They were able to effectively communicatein the Spanish-speaking community and felt comfortabledoing so.
Table 2 also indicatesthat IO percentof those we interviewedin Washington Heightsreportedto reador write Spanisheithernot well or not at all, compared to only 5 percentin Elmhurst/Corona.It is importantto recall that28 percentof those in WashingtonHeights claimed not to have finished elementaryschool, comparedto only I percentin Elmhurst/Corona.We were puzzled by the discrepancy between the answers obtained for years of schooling and those for Spanish literacy proficiency. Based on years of schooling, we would have expected a greaterdivergence between the WashingtonHeights sample and the Elmhurst/Coronasample on Spanish literacy.
During the study we became aware of what we thought was a discrepancy

between self-report on Spanish literacy and actual literacy. One of the researchers in Washington Heights reportedthat she had intervieweda person whom she knew to have limitedliteracyin Spanish.Yet, thatpersonhadtold her thatshe readandwroteSpanishwell. We decidedthatwe wouldquestionfurther those respondentswhose answerto the schooling questionandthe Spanishliteracy questionseemedcontradictory.We questionedthemon theirSpanishliteracy habitsand theirattitudestowardit. In addition,we gave themthe last sectionof the questionnaireto fill out by themselves.
The eighteenpeople who werequestionedfurtherwere Dominicanresidentsof WashingtonHeights. They all insistedthatthey readwell, althoughnoneof them
was able to successfully complete the questionnairewithout the researcher's help. When we inquiredfurther,they told us thatthey readwell popularmagazines such as Selecciones, Vanidades, Buen Hogar, the fotonovelas (photographicsoap operaromances),the Bible, as well as the Dominicannewspaper El Nacional andthe SpanishlanguagepressEl Diario. They also maintainedthat they understoodwell the few signs andadvertisementsin Spanishthatthey see in the subway. They reportedwriting letters in Spanish frequentlyto family and friends in the home country. When asked whetherthey ever filled out formsor
took tests in Spanish, only three of the eighteen had ever filled out a form in Spanish and none had ever taken a test in Spanishin the United States.
It turnsout thatwhatthese respondentsweresayingwas thatherein the United States their literacy in Spanish is adequate. They are rarely confrontedwith writtenSpanish in their daily lives. When they are, it is highly contextualized with familiarmessages frombackhomeor accompaniedwithpictorialmessages. Their literacy in Spanish is sufficient to readthe few signs and advertisements thatthey see in the subwayandthe magazinesthatthey look at. Althoughbackat home havinglimitedliteracyin Spanishmighthave restrictedtheiropportunities, in the United States it is theirlack of English literacythatmakesthe difference.
We had first assumed that many respondentswere lying abouttheirSpanish literacy skills to avoid embarrassment.This limitationof self-reportlanguage data is well known. However, when we probed furtherwe found that these eighteen people were sincere in the evaluationof their skills. For them, their literacyskills in Spanishareentirelyadequatein an English-speakingsociety that rarely calls for them or makes use of them. For us, literacy in Spanish was measuredby the academic yardstickof a monolingualsociety where Spanishis used for all functions. Whereaswe relied on a purely linguistic and academic definition of Spanish literacy, these respondentsclearly understoodthe sociofunctionaldimensionsof literacy. They hadnot lied. They merelysaw language and literacy less in an analytic and abstractway and more as an instrumentto fulfill certainfunctionsin theirown lives. Given the limitedfunctionsof literacy in Spanish in the United States, they judged their Spanish literaryskills to be
completely satisfactory. On the otherhand, we heardmanypeople in Elmhurst/Coronatell us thattheir

SPANISH LANGUAGE USE AND ATTITUDES
literacyin Spanishwas poor despite having finishedelementaryschool. At least five told us thatthey were forgettingtheirSpanishandyet not learningEnglish. It seems that these more educatedspeakersof Spanishwerejudging theirskills based on the academic norm that they had learnedin the home country. They judged their literacy skills in Spanish to be inadequatebecause their metalinguistic awarenessenabled them to comparetheir literacyto thatexpected in monolingual societies.
Whereas uneducatedspeakersevaluate their languageperformancebased on the adequacyof meetinga particularsociofunctionalneed, moreeducatedspeakers judge their performanceby comparingit to the norms of the system. This discrepancyis importantto keep in mindin evaluatingself-reportson language proficiency. Uneducated speakers may frequently overestimate their literacy ability, and educatedspeakersmay frequentlyunderestimateit.
Hispanic illiterateadults need to be taughtthe forms and structuresof their native language, but they also need to be exposed to the differentfunctionsof literacy in society beyond those in their immediatelives. It is importantthat as we teach Hispanics with limited literacy to read and write both Spanish and English, we teach them to read signs and fill out forms. But it is equally importanto expose themto the literaryworksof EugenioManrade Hostos, Juan Bosch, Jose Marti, Octavio Paz, GabrielGarciaMa6rqueza,nd the many others who make up the Hispanicliterarytradition.
The English languageproficiencyof Hispanicsin WashingtonHeights is also less than that of Hispanics in Elmhurst/Corona.Table 2 indicatesthat approximately half of those we interviewedin WashingtonHeights say thatthey don't speak English, comparedto only one-thirdof those in Elmhurst/Corona.Althoughapproximatelyhalf the WashingtonHeightsHispanicpopulationis monolingual in Spanish, two-thirdsof the Hispanic populationin Elmhurstis bilingual.
One interestingresultof our interviewsis thatalmost half of the Hispanicsin Elmhurst,comparedto a handfulin WashingtonHeights, reportthat they had learnedEnglish in theircountryof origin and not in the United States. It seems that middle-class status in Latin America generally includes schooling in English. Middle-class status is not, then, a result of speaking English but is the reasonwhy moreEnglish is spoken. This also explainedthe surprisingresultthat more Hispanics in Elmhurst/Coronaclaim to write English well than speak English well. Hispanicswho are schooled in English in theircountriesof origin are comfortable reading and writing English, although they lack comparable speakingskills. Inthe UnitedStates, theyoften readthe pressin Englishandthey are naturallysurroundedwith English print. However, since their socialization patternis mostly amongotherSpanishspeakers,they rarelyhave an opportunity to practice speaking English. As expected, the middle-class community has betterliteracy skills in both the native languageand the second language.
The results on language proficiency of the two communitiesare extremely

importantto keep in mind when establishingprogramsto teach English as a second language (ESL). AlthoughtraditionalESL classes might suffice for the literateHispanicpopulationof Elmhurst/Coronat,hey areclearlyinadequatefor some of the Hispanicsof WashingtonHeights. In communitieswith a largerate of illiteracy in the native language, only an approachthat would incorporate developmentof literacy in the native languageas well as developmentof communicativeandliteracyskills in the secondlanguageseems appropriateF. urthermore, whereas an ESL grammatical-basedsyllabus might be adequatefor educated speakersof Spanish, uneducatedspeakersof Spanishneedto be introduced to English through a communicative-basedsyllabus that fulfills their English language needs for specific functions.
Linguistic behavior in the two communities
The use of two languagesis often detenninedby the linguisticproficiencyof the community. Given the more monolingual natureof the WashingtonHeights community, we can then expect that more Spanish will be used there than in Elmhurst/Corona.The results in Tables 3 and 4 confirm that in Washington Heights Hispanics watch more television in Spanish, listen to more Spanish language radio stations, read more in Spanish, and talk to each other more in Spanish than in Elmhurst.However, the qualitativedifferencesrevealedby the data on Spanish languageuse by the two communitiesis interestinglydifferent.
With regardto the frequencywith which Spanishis used in watchingtelevision, listening to the radio, and reading, it is most interestingthat the least popularSpanishmediumin bothcommunitiesis television(see Table3). Thatis, less Hispanicsclaim to always watchtelevision in Spanishthanthose who claim to always listen to the radio in Spanishor always read in Spanish. When they watch television, Hispanics tune into an English languagechannelmuch more

frequentlythanwhen they listen to the radio. Whenthey read, morethanhalf of the populationonly readsin Spanish.Englishlanguagetelevision seems to be the media which most often invadesSpanish-speakinghomes. This is not surprising given the highly contextualizednatureof the language on television. English language television is a language resource which offers monolingual Spanish speakers the possibility of acquiringreceptive knowledge of English. This is importantto keep in mind when establishingESL programsfor the community. Latinos in Spanish-speakingcommunitiesare quickly gaining receptiveknowledge of English throughwatchingEnglish languagetelevision. It is active communicative skills in English that Hispanic adultsneed. We feel, therefore,that methodsof teachingESL thatexpose Spanish-speakingadultsto prolongedsilent periods (such as Asher's Total Physical Response) are totally inadequatefor Hispanics in the United States. More interactive and dialogical approaches should be taken in teaching English to Hispanicadults.
Another reason for the popularityof English language television and radio seems to be thatmost of the adultswe interviewedhadoften watchedAmerican television programsandlistenedto Americanrockmusic in theirhomecountries. NorthAmericanimages andsoundsarevery familiarto all LatinAmericans.It is the English language, needed for readingand also for trueparticipationin U.S. society, that remainsunknownand incomprehensible.
Often children introduceSpanish-speakingadultsto English languagetelevision programming.Since most programmingis relevantforthe whole family, the adults quickly tune in. This does not happen with reading. Although children often bring English books home, they remainchildren's books. Adults seldom are interestedin the contentof the school books thatchildrenbring home. The readingmaterialin which adults are interestedremainsexclusively in Spanish, whether it is a newspaperor a Vanidades.
Although Hispanics are quickly gaining receptive knowledge of English throughwatchingEnglishlanguagetelevision, they most often lackthe academic decontextualizedlanguage skills necessaryto read English effectively. Most of

the people we interviewed had been educated in Spanish in their country of origin. They often have no choice but to readthe many Spanishlanguagepublications that are available in the two communitiesstudied. Therefore,reading turnsout to be the most popularSpanishmediumin both communities.
Our interviewsrevealedthatit was the Spanishlanguagenewspaperfromthe country of origin that was most often read by the community. The Spanish language foreign press seems to offer a different content, of interest to the Hispanicpopulation,thatcannotbe found in the English languagepress. Reading in Spanish remainsa necessity in orderto keep informedof events in the home country. This fact is importantfor the Spanish language television and radioindustryin the UnitedStates. Althoughinformationaboutthe UnitedStates in Spanish is extremely important,Hispanicsare very much interestedin Latin America. They are not satisfied with the news and content about their home countries which Spanish language television stations in the United States give them. This is anotherreason why Hispanicsmore often abandonthe television programsin Spanishfor those in English, thanthey give up readingin Spanish for reading in English.
Reading in Spanishemerges as a valued skill in both communities.Of those who claimed to readand write English, well over two-thirdssaid thatthey read frequentlyin Spanishbecause they preferredto do so. Even thoughsome of the more assimilatedHispanicswe interviewedfrequentlyshowed contemptfor the novelas 'soap operas'on the Spanishlanguagetelevision stationsandthe merengues and other Caribbeandance tunes on the Spanish languageradio stations, they praisedthe LatinAmericanliteraturethey readin Spanishas the best in the world. The more educated Hispanics we interviewedfrequentlymentionedthe works of GabrielGarciaMa.rquez,Mario VargasLlosa, and Carlos Fuentesin connectionwith theirSpanishreading.The less educatedHispanicsreadnovelas by ConrnTellado andotherauthorsand magazinessuch as VanidadesandBuen Hogar. It becameobvious thatwhereasSpanishlanguageradioandtelevision in the United States reflect only the popularculture, Spanishlanguagereadingis able to capturethe popular,as well as the elite culture;the foreign,as well as the Hispanic culture in the United States. Surprisinglyenough, both educatedand uneducatedspeakersof Spanish and assimilatedand nonassimilatedHispanics have moreuse for Spanishlanguagereadingthanfor Spanishlanguagetelevision or radio.
This againhas consequencesfor educationalpolicy. Spanishlanguagereading seems to be a desirableskill in a Spanish-speakinghome, andthe abilityto read is seen by the communityas a functionof schooling (see next section). Hispanic childrenin the United Stateseasily have access to the Spanishthat is spoken in their neighborhoods,on their television sets, and on their radios. But the oral medium in these ethnic domains does not enjoy the prestige of the literate medium capable of reflecting both the popular and the elite culture (Flores, Attinasi, & Pedraza I98I). Hispanic children in the United States, however,

rarelyhave access to Spanishliteracybecauseschools do not teachthem Spanish once they speak English. Thus, althoughmany Hispanicchildrenin New York continueto speaksome Spanishat home with parentsand continueto hearit on Channel41 or 47, on RadioWADO or WKAQ, andin theirneighborhoods,they quickly lose their limited ability to read and write Spanish. It seems that if schools taughtHispanicchildrento readin Spanishregardlessof linguisticproficiency, they would give themaccess to a literateHispanicculturethatis often not obtainableat home. In the process of makingHispanicchildrenliteratein Spanish, they would increase their opportunitiesfor incorporationand success in North Americansociety.
With regardto Spanishlanguage use with other interlocutors,we can see in Table 4 thateven though more English is spoken in Elmhurst,the great divergence in the two communitiesoccurs upon leaving the home domain. With the father, the mother, and the siblings, both communitiesuse Spanish almost exclusively. However, out of the home domainthe residentsof Elmhurstuse much more English with friends, schoolmates, and co-workers than those of Washington Heights. The bilingual/multiethnicand middle-class characterof the Elmhurstcommunityforces the residentsto come into contact with Anglos and otherethnicswho do not speakSpanish,as well as with otherHispanicswho are alreadybilingual and with whom both Spanish and English is frequentlyused.
The economic vitalityandethnicvariationwithina communitydoes not weaken the use of Spanish within the home. This reveals the strengthof Spanish in both communities. The more middle-class and multiethniccommunity is not abandoningSpanishto speakEnglish. It uses Englishas a meansof communication with its more middle-classsocial circles and in orderto communicatewith otherethnic groups that live in the community. However, at home, English is rarelyused as a sole meansof communication,even with the youngerchildren.
Language attitudesin the two communities
Given that Spanish is used less frequentlyin the public domain in the middleclass andmultiethniccommunity,loyaltytowardSpanishstill remainsextremely strongin bothcommunities.Bothcommunitiesexpress anoverwhelminginterest in maintainingSpanishand in having the schools teach in Spanish, while at the same time acknowledgingthe great importanceof English in the United States (see Table 5).

extensive use of Spanishas the privatelanguagein the home amongmembersof the family, as well as in reading, in both communities. In addition, the monolingualSpanishspeakerswe interviewedsupportthe use of Spanishin emergency andsocial services, ballots, andadvertisementsas a meansof facilitatingtheir participationin U.S. society. BilingualHispanicsalso favorthe use of Spanishin public settings to help their monolingualcompatriots.
The supportfor bilingual education is also overwhelming. Those whom we interviewedoverwhelminglyfeel that the animosityof U.S. society towardthe Spanishlanguagemakes it absolutelynecessaryfor the schools to supportthem in transmittingthe Spanish language to their children. Most parentsfeel that withoutthe supportof the school, they will be totally ineffective in maintaining the Spanishof theirchildren.All f'!elthatSpanishliteracyis needed in orderto develop the Spanishof the children.This feeling is sharedbothby poor illiterate Hispanics and by middle-class literate and educated Hispanics. Both communities wanttheirchildrento be bilingualandbiliterate.They wantthemto speak, read, andwriteEnglishas nativebornAmericans,butthey also wantthemto be able to speak, read, and write Spanishso thatthey can communicatewith their parents,theirgrandparentst,heirrelatives, andthe Spanish-speakingcommunity both in LatinAmericaand in the United States. The Hispanicswe interviewed supportthe privateand public use of Spanish in the United States.
At the same time, the interviews reveal that most recognize English as the publiclanguagein the UnitedStates, and too percentof the respondentsfeel it is extremelyimportantto learnit. Spanishis necessary, they told us, because it is neededto communicatewith othersin the home country,becauseit is the private language of the family, and because many Hispanics do not speak English. However, theirkeen preoccupationwith having theirchildrenschooled in Spanish did not connote an interest in having Spanishcompete with English in the United States. All the Hispanics we interviewed recognize the importanceof English, althoughthey also supportthe use of Spanishin U.S. society for their

own benefit. They do not understandthose who criticizetheiruse of Spanish, for they feel deeply loyal to the UnitedStates. And althoughmost arealmostfervent supportersof U.S. society, they turnedangry and disloyal when we told them about efforts being made to curtail services in Spanish in their communities. Fromloyal Spanish-speakingAmericans, they quickly turnedinto angryCentral Americans/Cubans/Dominicans/PuertRo icans/SouthAmericanswith claims of racism and discriminationin the United States and in starkopposition to U.S. policies in LatinAmerica. It is clearthatalthoughthe Hispanicswe interviewed recognize English as the public language in the United States, they stand radically opposed to what they see as the racistthreatposed to Spanishby the U.S. Englishmovement, which attemptsto make English the official languageof the United States.
THE FIVE NATIONAL ORIGIN GROUPS
Hispanicsare fiercely loyal as individualsto theircountryof origin. Thus, it is importantfor dataon linguisticproficiency, use, andattitudeto be also analyzed accordingto nationalorigin. Having data on the behavior and attitudeof the differentnationalgroups allows educatorsand social scientists to see relevant differencesamong Latinos.
Demographiccharacteristicsof thefive national groups The characteristicsrevealed by our data of the groups included in our sample, CentralAmericans,Cubans,Dominicans, PuertoRicans, and South Americans, are extremelyrelevantin any discussion of social policy for these groups.
As shown in Table 6, among the five groups, the Dominicans are the most recently arrived. Almost half of them have lived in New York less than five years. CentralAmericansand then South Americansfollow Dominicans in the recencyof theirarrivals.Approximatelyone-thirdof the CentralAmericansand one-fourthof the South Americanshave lived in the United States less thanfive years. OurPuertoRican and Cubansamples are longer-timeresidents, although both nationalgroups include a small numberof recent immigrants.
Our PuertoRican sample consists of only fifteen respondents. Thus, as we discussresults, it is importantfor the readerto bearin mindthatourPuertoRican sample is not only small but is also unrepresentativeof the majorityof Puerto Ricansin New YorkCity. Forexample, althoughPuertoRicansmakeup approximately70 percentof the Hispanicpopulationof New YorkCity, they areonly 5 percentof ourtotalsample. Only a small percentageof the PuertoRicanpopulation in New York can be found in the Hispanic neighborhoodsof Washington Heights and Elmhurst/Corona.Few have been able to escape the conditions of poverty in income, education, and housing in which most of them live in East Harlemand the South Bronx. Thirteenout of the fifteen PuertoRicans interviewed live in Elmhurst.Almost half of the Puerto Ricans in our sample are

More thanhalf of the Cubanswe interviewedhave been in the United States between eleven and twenty years, thus correspondingto the second wave of immigration(Llanes I982). OurCubansamplealso includesa small numberof Mariel immigrantswho arrivedin New York less than five years ago.
Dominicansare the youngest of the five nationalgroups. Over 50 percentof the Dominicansand CentralAmericanswe interviewedare youngerthan thirty years. They arefollowed in age by the SouthAmericans,the PuertoRicans, and finally, the older Cubans.
Dominicans have the lowest educationalcompletion figures of the five national groups. Twenty-six percent of the Dominicans we interviewed (thirtythreerespondents)have not finished elementaryschool. Two out of the twenty-

four CentralAmericansalso claim not to have finished elementaryschool. In contrast, all of the Cubans, South Americans, and Puerto Ricans whom we interviewedhave completedelementaryschool. The PuertoRicansin oursample have the mosteducation.All fifteen PuertoRicansarehigh school graduatesand six are college graduates.This is indicativeof the middle-classand professional statusof the PuertoRicanswho have eitherleft poorerneighborhoods,such as El Barrio,andmovedto Queensor who have come recentlyto Queens fromPuerto Rico as young professionals.
With regardto the occupationof the five groups, Dominicans in the United Statesaredistinguishedby a muchhigherunemploymentrate, a growingnumber of students,and a very limited numberof professionals. Thirty-threepercentof the Dominicans (42 out of I28) are blue collar workers. For reasons outlined above, the Puerto Ricans in our sample have the highest numberof students (seven out of fifteen) andalso of professionals(five out of fifteen). On the other hand, most Cubanswe interviewedare blue collar workersin the UnitedStates, although many claim to have been professionals back in Cuba. Cubans are distinguishedfromthe othergroupsby the highernumberof businessowners (14 percent)among the sample and follow PuertoRicans in the numberof professionals. More than half of the CentralAmericansthat we interviewedare blue collar workers. South Americans, with their higher rate of secondary school completion than Central Americans and Dominicans, but their lower rate of college graduatesthan PuertoRicans and Cubans, are distinguishedby a more numerous group of technicians and office clerks than any of the other five groups.
Linguisticproficiencyof thefive national groups The Spanishoral proficiencyof all the groups is excellent. Table 7 shows that ioo percentof all the groupsreportthatthey speakSpanishvery well. Overtwothirdsof all those interviewed, regardlessof nationalorigin, claim to read and write Spanishwell. All the South Americansin the sample reportfull literacyin Spanish.
Comparativelyspeaking, moreCentralAmericansclaim to have limited literacy in Spanish(17 percentor four out of twenty-fourpeople interviewed)than the Dominicans,who claim fewer yearsof schooling (only 9 percentor 12 out of 128 people interviewed).Besides revealingthe limitationsof self-reportdatathat we have alreadydiscussed, this last result indicates the danger of comparing nationalorigingroupswithoutregardfor theirtotalnumbersin the UnitedStates. In establishingsocial policy one needs to know not only the characteristicsof each nationalgroup, but also theirtotal numberin the communityfor which the policy is being considered. Even if the self-reportson literacy were objective, theremightbe less need of literacyprogramsfor CentralAmericansin New York (since theirabsolutenumberis smaller)thanfor Dominicans,whose numbersare rapidly growing.

As expected, morePuertoRicanshave oral proficiencyin Englishthanany of the otherfournationalorigingroups(see Table7). PuertoRicansarefollowed by South Americans, CentralAmericans, Cubans, and finally, Dominicans, who know the leastEnglish. Morethanhalf the Dominicanpopulationis monolingual in Spanish,while at least half of the Cuban,CentralAmerican,SouthAmerican, and PuertoRican populationthat we interviewedis bilingual.
Althoughmorethanhalf of the Cubansin our samplehave been in the United Statesfor over a decade, they ranksecond to the Dominicansin lack of English speakingability. The greaterSpanishmonolingualismof Cubansin the United Statesthanthatof Mexican-Americans,PuertoRicans, andother Hispanicshas been noted before (NCEP I982). This is despite, or maybe because of, the greatereconomic integrationof Cubans,especially in Dade County. One reason for the resultson the limited English speaking ability of Cubansin our sample might have to do with the higher language/literacyexpectationof the educated and the middleclass thatwe discussed earlier. The Cubansin our sample (over half of them of the second immigrationwave and likely to have been professionals) had access to the full rangeof the functionsof Spanishin Cuba. Their Englishis used for only limitedfunctionsin the UnitedStates, andtheyjudge it as inadequate.As will be seen below, however, Cubansindeed seem to speak less Englishwith theirco-workersthando SouthAmericans,PuertoRicans, and CentralAmericans.

groups.Table 8 confirmsthe fact thatDominicansclearly make more use of the Spanishlanguagemediathando the othernationalgroups. Only 9 percentof the Dominicanpopulationclaim never to watch Spanishlanguage television. More thanhalf the Dominicanpopulationalways listens to a Spanish language radio stationor always reads in Spanishratherthan in English. Overall, Dominicans use the Spanish language media exclusively much more often than do other Hispanicgroups.The othermorebilingualHispanicgroupshave less need of the Spanishlanguagemediabecausethey can also benefit fromthe Englishlanguage media.
Withthe exceptionof Cubans,over three-fourthsof the otherHispanicgroups watch Spanish language television and listen to Spanish language radio frequently, althoughnot exclusively. The Spanish language media has an important, althoughnot an exclusive, role in most Hispanichomes.
Surprisingly,although Cubans rank second in Spanish monolingualism, almost half reportthat they never watch Spanish language television or listen to Spanish language radio. Those whom we interviewed claim that the Spanish languageprogrammingwas irrelevantto them. When we asked them why this
was so, they most often said that "esas novelas no sirven para nada" 'Those
soap operas are no good'. They were so unfamiliar with Spanish language television programmingthatthey rarelywere able to tell us whetherthere were other programsin Spanish besides novelas. They told us that they understood enoughEnglishto be able to watchEnglishlanguagetelevision. Theirdislike for Spanish language television and radio was not based on language preference. Rather,whatwe gatheredfromthe interviewswas thatthey felt a class difference betweenthemselvesandthe Hispanicaudiencefor whom the novelas were aired.

collar workersin the UnitedStates, they are likely to have been professionalsin Cuba. In fact, 41 percentclaim to be college educated(see Table 6). One Cuban womanwho has lived in WashingtonHeightsfor sixteen yearstold us, "que uno
le pierde el gusto a esas novelas" 'One stops enjoying those soap operas'. She told us that she regularlywatched them when she first arrivedin New York. Now, she is no longerinterestedin thebabiesbornoutof wedlockto the maidsof rich Latin Americanmen, the content, she claims, of most soap operas. She explainedthatherpresentrealityin the United Statesas the single parentof two teenagegirls is verydifferentfromthatportrayedin the novelas. The novelas "lo embobecena uno" 'drugyou'. It seems thatbesides education,degreeof assimilationto U.S. society is also an importantdeterminerof participationin Spanish languagetelevisionprogramming.Thedecision to use the minoritylanguage in a majoritysociety does not always depend on linguistic ability or preference. Sometimesit dependson the role andthe functionswhich the minoritylanguage has, or is allowed to have, in the majoritysociety.
Reading in Spanish is again the most favorite Spanish language medium of every single Hispanicgroup(see Table 8). Withthe exceptionof PuertoRicans, moreclaim to readexclusively in Spanishthanto watchtelevision or listento the radioonly in Spanish. Even the two groupswith higherilliteracyin Spanish, the CentralAmericansand the Dominicans, follow this pattern.
As shown in Table 9, regardlessof national origin, Spanish is also almost exclusively used at home withthe father,the mother,andthe siblings. Spanishis also used extensively, although not exclusively, with the children. The least Spanish at home is spoken among the PuertoRicans in our sample.
Table 9 also reveals that South Americansand CentralAmericansclaim to separatethe two languagesat home morethanCubans,Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans. That is, South and Central Americans report to speak either always Spanish or always English at home with their parentsand their siblings and almostalways with theirchildren.MoreCubansand PuertoRicansreportto use the two languagesin addressingthe parents,the siblings, and the children.
We askedthose Cubanswho claimed to speakeitherEnglish or both Spanish and English to their childrenwhy they did it and what they meantby speaking both languages. The 23 percent who claimed to speak only English to their childrentold us thattheirchildrensimply did not speak Spanish, althoughmost said thatthe childrenunderstoodSpanish. However, the 27 percentwho claimed to use both languages with their children reportedthat their children were bilingual, althoughthey felt the childrenunderstoodsome thingsin Englishbetter. The respondentsused English when their children's English-speakingfriends were present and when they helped them with their homework. They spoke Spanishwhen they were alone andwhenthey werediscussingwhetherto buy the new bicycle. They simply had not made a conscious language choice when addressingtheirchildren. They used the languagethat was most appropriateto the situationat hand. They spoke sometimes Spanish, sometimes English.

It became clear that they were mostly describing intersententiallanguage alternation.It is importanto pointout thatnone of this behaviorwas exhibitedin the interviewswith the researchteam, althoughtherewas much use of loans and calques when they spoke in Spanishwith us. This was not surprisingsince the researchteam consisted of people who were very proficientin Spanishand our respondentswere reportinglanguage alternationwith interlocutorswho might have been less proficientin Spanish. It seems thatsince almosthalf of the Cuban parentsin New York reportspeakingeither solely English or both English and Spanishto theirchildren,these Cuban-Americanchildrenwill have a very slight chance of becoming fully proficient in Spanish. Given the fact that CubanAmericanchildrenrarelyspendtime in a monolingualSpanish-speakingsociety and that the Cubancommunityin New York City is not as cohesive as that in Dade County or in New Jersey, we can predict that many Cuban-American childrenin New York will find it difficult to continue speaking Spanish.
The small numberof PuertoRicans in our samplereporta slightly higheruse of English, and EnglishandSpanish, in the home thanCubans.Theiranswersto our questions are very similarto those we obtainedfromCubans.They also use sometimes Spanish, sometimes English in addressingtheir children. However,

theiractuallanguagebehaviorwith us was slightly different.Forexample, only nine persons in the entire sample surveyedpreferredto answer in English. Of these, four were Puerto Rican. We believe that the reason for their language choice was partlydeterminedby the fact that no one in the researchteam was PuertoRican. Englishwas a moreneutrallanguageto communicatewith us than their more markedNuyorican Spanish. These English-speakingPuerto Ricans often code-switchedbackto Spanishwith the researchteam, most often intrasententially.At leastone of themreportedthathe spoke bothSpanishandEnglishto his daughter "como ahora" 'just like now'. The eleven Puerto Ricans who spoke to us in Spanish(all with at least a high school education)rarelyswitched to English, althoughthey also frequentlyused loans and calques from English. Regardlessof languageuse at home, it seems thatPuertoRican childrenhave a higherprobabilityof Spanishlanguageregenerationas adultsthanCuban-American children.First, PuertoRicanchildrenfrequentlytravelto PuertoRico to see family and friends, whereasCubanchildrenhave lost touch with the homeland. Second, PuertoRicanchildrengrowingup in any New YorkCity neighborhood will have opportunitiesas young adults to become involved with the large and strugglingPuertoRican communityin the City.
We had expected the more monolingualDominicansto use more Spanish at homethananyof theothergroups. However, Dominicansuse moreSpanishthan Cubansand PuertoRicans, but slightly less thanCentraland South Americans. We were also surprisedthat 15 percentof the Dominicans, comparedto only 5 percentof CentralAmericansand 2 percentof South Americans, claim to use both Spanishand English with theirchildren. We were puzzled by at least four Dominicans who told us that they spoke both Spanish and English to their children when it became obvious to us that they were not English speakers. Whenwe probedthem further,it turnedout thatthey were describingthe use of some very few well-known English loans such as el estfn 'steam' and el bildin 'building' when speaking Spanish to their children. Yet, the fact that these Dominicanswere quickto reportspeakingboth languagesto theirchildren,even when unable to do so, teaches us an importantlesson about the loyalty of Hispanicimmigrantsto the UnitedStatesandto the Englishlanguage,as well as the linguisticdiscriminationthey encounter.At least threeDominicansreported thatwhenthey spoke Spanishthey were classified as poor, uneducated,andeven as illegal aliens. However, whenthey spokeEnglish, they couldbe classifiedjust as Hispanicsin the United States, and some non-Hispanicsmight even confuse them with PuertoRicans, who have citizenship privileges. The effort of some Dominicansto speak English, even when they don't know how is revealed by theirdescriptionof theirlinguistic behavior. Althoughcode-switchingis a stigmatizedlinguisticpracticeamongeducatedbilingualspeakers,it seems to be an acceptedpracticeamong monolingualSpanishspeakerswho lack a formaleducation, have recently arrived, do not have the full ability to code-switch, and believe thatEnglishholds the key to theirsuccess in the UnitedStates.

using loans and switchingoccasionally demonstratestheirlimited knowledge of English and is a first step in their acquisitionof English.
It is interestingto note that the three groups from the Caribbean, namely, Cubans,PuertoRicans, and Dominicans, reportusing both Spanishand English in the privacy of their homes more often than Central Americans and South Americans.It seems thatthe reportof this languagebehavioris partlydue to the stigmatizationof CaribbeanSpanishin the UnitedStates, as well as to the greater discriminationthat Caribbeanspeakers encounter (based, of course, on both linguistic and racial grounds). Although everyone we interviewed reportedto speak Spanishvery well or well, some of the Cubans, Dominicans, and Puerto RicansreportedthattheirSpanishwas not as good as thatof theirSouth American and CentralAmericanfriends. They said that the Spanish they spoke was heavily influencedby Englishandthatin speakingthey often "swallow" sounds (nos comemos las letras). Some may then prefer to abandontheir stigmatized varietyof Spanishin favor of English. This may partiallyexplain why Dominicans, morerecent, moremonolingual,andless educatedthanSouthandCentral Americans,reportto speak both languagesat home more often.
South and CentralAmericans are also less likely to reportthe use of both SpanishandEnglishsince they regardthis as the linguisticcharacteristicof poor, moreraciallymarkedHispanics,especially PuertoRicans, who have been in the United States for many years. In actualbehavior, however, the Spanish of the Centraland South Americans we interviewed was also deeply influenced by English.
Differencesin linguisticbehavioramongnationalgroupsbecame most apparent outsideof the homecontext. On the whole, Dominicansuse the most Spanish with friends, co-workers,and classmates. The Dominicansof our sample, with the leasteducation,the highestrateof illiteracy, andthe least prestigiousoccupations, are excluded from social, work, and schooling opportunitieswhere English is used. On the otherhand, South Americanscome into most contact with English-speakingco-workers and classmates. We must remember that South Americanshave the highest percentageof people employed as technicians and office workers.On the whole, SouthAmericansin New YorkCity interactmore withan English-speakingsociety, althoughthisdoes not implythatthey aremore structurallyincorporatedinto the United States society.
Forexample, curiouslyenough, Cubansrarelycome into contactwith English monolingualco-workers.This, however, is only indicativeof the success of the Spanish-speakingand bilingual Cuban business and professional community. This business and professionalethnic communityfunctions mostly in Spanish, servingmostly a Hispanicclientele andemployingmostly Hispanicworkers.The publicuse of Spanishin the United Statescannotbe solely seen as an indication of lackof structurailncorporation.In fact, for manyHispanics,Spanishseems to be an importanttool for successful business endeavors.

Speakersof a more prestigiousCentraland South AmericanSpanishreportto compartmentalizeits use from English much morethanspeakersof CaribbeanSpanish,regardlessof social class. Speakersof CaribbeanSpanish, whether Cubans, Dominicans, or Puerto Ricans, tend to alternatelanguagesmuch moreoften thanCentralAmericansand South Americans. This is a surprisingfindingsince it suggests thatvariablessuch as recency of arrivaland level of education may not be as importantin determiningthe degree of compartmentalizationas is the prestige of the dialect spoken by the community,the social statusof the linguisticgroupin the UnitedStates, andthe identificationof the ethnic group with regardto the United States.
Language attitudesof thefive national groups
Therearemanydifferencesin the reportedlinguisticbehaviorof the five national groupsstudied.However, as shown in Table io, all overwhelminglyassertthatit is importantto lean English, maintainSpanish, and have the schools teach in Spanish.
Onlyone Dominican,one PuertoRican, andone Cubansay thatSpanishis not importantto them. Only two Dominicansand two South Americansclaim that Spanishshouldnot be taughtin the publicschool. The two SouthAmericanstold us in our interviews that bilingual teachers in New York City public schools, usually long-timeresidentsin the United States, lacked the appropriateSpanish skills to teachSpanish. Yet, seven of the South Americanswe interviewedsend their childrento Saturdayschools organizedby the Argentine and Uruguayan communitiesof Queenspreciselyto learnthe Spanishlanguageandtheirculture. South Americanteachersrarelyqualify for jobs as bilingual teachers in public schools since most have not been educated in the United States, and they frequently lack the English skills necessary for certification.

THE CASE OF ONE NATIONAL GROUP IN TWO COMMUNITIES: THE DOMINICANS OF WASHINGTON HEIGHTS AND ELMHURST/CORONA
Most immigrantsto the United States originally settle in communities where othersof the same nationalgroupreside. Often, therefore,the characteristicsof the community coincide with those of the national group residing within its boundaries.This ethnic enclave provides the newly arrivedimmigrantwith an atmospherethatis culturallyandlinguisticallyfamiliar.It serves to ease the often painfultransitionbetween the home countryand the new society.
Language minority communities in the United States, especially Spanishspeaking communities, are most often poor. Immigrantsto the United States rarely have economic wealth when they arrive. However, immigrationto the UnitedStates is not solely promptedby the pull of economic opportunitiesin the new society. Often the political situation of the home countries pushes the immigrantsout. The sociopoliticalclimate in the Spanish-speakingworld, many times createdby North Americanpolicies in Latin America, forces many welleducatedprofessionalsto emigrate to the United States. Thus, although most arrivepenniless, there are differences in social class among immigrantsof the same ethnic group.
At first, many middle-class immigrantsmay live side by side with their less fortunatecompatriots.However, these middle-class immigrantshave the skills and values necessary in U.S. society. They are often the only ones to succeed and to leave the poor ethnic neighborhoodfor more integratedareas. Often, however, middle-class immigrants,althoughpoor in the new society, preferto live in areaswherethe residentsare not solely of the same nationalorigin. They prefera neighborhoodthat is less ethnically markedand that offers them better housing and schools.
The questionof whethersocial policy for Hispanicsin the UnitedStatesshould be guidedby categorizationsof nationaloriginor ethniccommunityis an important one. In this section we will argue that given the social structureof North Americansociety, the language surroundof an ethnic groupbecomes an important indicatorof language proficiency, language use, and language attitudes.2 Comparingthe answersobtainedfromthe Dominicanswe interviewedin Washington Heights and those we interviewedin Elmhurst/Coronagives us valuable insight into the variabilityof ethnic groups in differentcommunities.

staple in the Dominicandiet. After I966, Dominicans, most of them from the town of Sabana Iglesia, also startedsettling in the less urban, less congested neighborhoodof Coronain Queens. Until the mid-i960s Coronahadbeen mainly a blacklower-middle-classneighborhood.In the early I96os LatinAmericans startedsettlingin the areaof Elmhurst/Coronae, specially to the west of Junction Boulevard.In the 1970S some middle-classDominicansstartedbuyingthe small homeseast of JunctionBoulevardfrommanyblacks. The Dominicansin Sabana Iglesia, as Coronais called, include a numberof educated,middle-classprofessionals such as medical doctors, architects,and engineers who have a difficult time finding high salariedjobs in the DominicanRepublic.
As shown in Table ii the recent influx of Dominicans has affected both
Washington Heights and Elmhurst/Coronaequally. Almost 50 percent of the Dominicansin WashingtonHeights, as well as those in Elmhurst/Corona,have been in the United States less than five years. However, 30 percent in WashingtonHeights, comparedto only 15 percentin Elmhurst/Corona,have lived in

the United States for more than a decade. This is an interestingfinding. One would expect that the longer-timeresidents might alreadybe more assimilated andmighthave left the poorerethnic neighborhood.However, the demographic data on level of education and occupation in Table ii reveals why years of residencyin the United States rarelyaffects incorporationinto the mainstream.
Although our sample's age distributionis similar, there are significant differenceswith respectto academiclevel. The thirty-threeDominicanswho claim not to have finished elementaryschool are all residentsof WashingtonHeights. Althoughslightly over one-thirdin WashingtonHeights claim to have finished high school and three are college graduates,almost three-fourthsof the Elmhurst/CoronaDominicansarehigh school graduatesand almost one-fourthhave finishedcollege. These differencesin educationarealso reflectedin occupation. Most of our WashingtonHeights and Elmhurst/Coronasamples are blue collar workers in the United States, this despite the higher education level in their native countryof those in Elmhurst/Corona.The difference is felt however, in the greaterincorporationof the more educated Elmhurst/CoronaDominicans into the work force. Only 4 percent of the Dominicans in Elmhurst/Corona, comparedto I4 percentin WashingtonHeights, are unemployed.Thereare also many more professionalsand office workersin Elmhurst/Coronathanin WashingtonHeights. The less educatedDominicansof WashingtonHeights have less opportunityfor incorporationinto the mainstream.
At least two of the middle-class Dominicans we interviewed in Elmhurst/Coronareportthat they prefertheir neighborhoodto WashingtonHeights because they would rathernot associate themselves with less educatedDominicans. They also told us thatthey don't want othersto categorize them as poor, undocumented,and illiterateDominicans. Although prejudice against Dominicans abounds in Washington Heights, Colombians seem to be the target of discriminatorypractices in Elmhurst/Corona.The discriminationhere is not basedon race, for the Colombiansaremostly white, whereasthe Dominicansare moreraciallymixed. However, Colombiansarestereotypedas drugdealers, and theirnumericdensity in the area has promotedthe stereotype. The presence of Dominicans is not an issue in the community, and therefore, they can slip by unnoticed.
Linguisticproficiency
Given the higher level of education of Dominicans in Elmhurst/Corona,we expected that they would claim much better Spanish literacy skills. We were surprisedby the little differencereportedin the two communities(see Table I2). Again, we feel thatthe limitationof self-reporton languageproficiencyas well as the restrictedrole andstatusof Spanishin the UnitedStates, discussed earlier, may be responsiblefor this result. Given the limited functionof Spanish in the UnitedStates, Spanishspeakersoverwhelminglyfeel thattheirSpanishskills are adequate.It is their inadequacyin English that is strongly felt.

AlthoughSpanishproficiencyreportsaresimilarin bothcommunities,thereis a slight differencein theirreportsof Englishproficiency(see Table 12). Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronaare indeed slightly more bilingual and biliteratethan those in WashingtonHeights. They also reportEnglish proficiencyin the same way as the restof the Elmhurst/Coronacommunity.Thatis, morereportto read and write English well than to speak English well.
Our interviewswith those who reportedthis apparentcontradictionrevealed thatin the DominicanRepublic,as in otherLatinAmericancountries,the middle class often learnedEnglishin schools. Manyreportedthe failureof the schools in teaching them to speak English. They claimed, however, to be familiar with English grammarand to read English well.
Language use
Judging from the demographiccharacteristicsof Dominicans in Washington Heights and Elmhurst/Corona,we also expected that those in Washington Heights would watch more Spanishlanguagetelevision, listen to more Spanish languageradio, readmore in Spanish, and speak more Spanishwith othersthan Dominicansin Elmhurst/Corona.We also expected that the more middle-class Dominicansof Elmhurst/Coronawould express the same negative attitudestoward Spanish language television and radio that we had heard from Cuban respondents.Furthermore,we expected that the Spanishof the Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronawould be differentfromthatof the Dominicansin Washington Heights.
Table 13 reveals that Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronaindeed make less exclusive use of Spanish language television, radio, and reading than those in

WashingtonHeights. Yet, the differencebetweenthe use of the Spanishmedia in the two communitiesis not as profoundas we would have expected, given the social class difference.
Whenwe probedthe Dominicansin Elmhurst/Coronafurther,it turnsout that althoughthey are criticalof the novelas, they reportwatching them. "Son tan bobas pero tan interesantes" 'They are so silly, but so interesting', a young dentalassistanttold us. Only 14 percentclaim neverto watch Spanishlanguage television. An interesting finding is that none of the Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronareportneverto listen to Spanishradio. Manytold us they regularly listened to Radio WADO and SUPER-KA-QUhoping to find merengues. Dominican music, and in particularmerengues, dominates the Latin American music world. Dominicans are proud of their music, and they play and dance merenguesregardlessof social class. These recently arrivedDominicans have not assimilatedthe contemptfor popularculturethat is the norn in the United States. In Latin America, the middle class participatesactively in the popular culture of the working class. Although one would rarely find a high-ranking executive of a U.S. corporationdancingto rapmusic, one rarelyfinds members of the elite in LatinAmericaunableto dancea conga, a merengue,or a cha-chach4.
The Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronaalso claim to read materialin Spanish that is similarto thatread in WashingtonHeights. El Nacional, the Dominican press, andEl Diario, the Spanishlanguagepress in New York, rankfirstin their preferences.It was surprisingthatthe Dominicansin Elmhurst/Coronaseem to manifesteven less interestin LatinAmericanandDominicanliteraturethanthose in WashingtonHeights. Juan Bosch, a contemporaryDominican writer, was mentionedin connectionto readingpracticesonly in WashingtonHeights. Only

one of the Dominicanswe interviewed,againin WashingtonHeights, mentioned any other Latin Americanwriter. Dominican literaturehas not partakenof the international"boom" of Latin American literature.Therefore, many Dominicans do not see LatinAmericanliteratureas theirown.
At least two of the Dominicans we interviewed in WashingtonHeights are young poets belonging to a Dominican poetry group that specializes in poesfa comprometida'politicallycommittedpoetry'. We were surprisedby the number of Dominicans in WashingtonHeights who told us that they wrote poetry and shortstories. Many of the poets reportreadingtheirpoetryregularlyat cultural events. Inthe moreethnicallymarkedcommunityof WashingtonHeightsthereis an emergent Dominican literature.This again is an interestingfinding. Most Hispanicliteraturein the United States falls clearly underthe category of literatura de protesta. The poorer community that feels victimized and frustrated expressesthatanguishin creativewriting.The more successful communitydoes not feel the need to develop a literary identity in Spanish. Not only are the reading practices in Spanish of the more educated Dominicans of Elmhurst/Coronanot different from those in WashingtonHeights, but the use of Spanishin literaryactivities seems to be valued less.
Dominicansin WashingtonHeightsandElmhurstarealso quitesimilarin their reportedlanguageuse in the home domain(see Table 14). Even amongthe more educatedDominicansof Elmhurst/Coronatherearereportsof use of both Spanish andEnglishwith siblings andchildren.Since the reportsof English language proficiency among the two communities are not that different (see Table 12), language use outside of the home does not differ much. Clearly, however, althoughsome of the bilingualresidentsof WashingtonHeightscontinueto use Spanishwith theirmostly Dominicanfriends,co-workers,andclassmates, those in Elmhurst/Coronahave moreEnglish-speakingandbilingualfriends,co-workers, andclassmates. Some of the Dominicansin Elmhurst/Coronawho claim to use English or both English and Spanish in their interactionswith friends, co-

workers, and classmates referred to the interethnicnature of their language surround.For example, one young woman told us that she worked in a local factoria where Blacks and Hispanicsof many nationalorigins work. She often spoke to other Hispanics and even to other Dominicans in English so that her Black co-workerscould understand.One young Dominicancollege freshmanin Elmhurst/Coronatold us that he preferredto speak English with his classmates because it was more neutral.He goes to a communitycollege in Queens where most of the Hispanicstudentsare South Americanor PuertoRican. He said his accent in English was similar to that of other young Hispanics. However, his accent in Spanish is clearly Dominican.
The actual language behavior of Dominicans in Washington Heights and Elmhurst/Coronavis-a-vis Spanish and English is also not much different. All the Dominicanswe interviewedpreferredto answerin Spanish. All answeredin fluent Spanishwith lexical featuresthat were clearly Dominican. For example, Dominicans both in WashingtonHeights and Elmhurst/Coronaregularly substitute casimente 'almostly' for casi 'almost'. However, the more educated Dominicansof Elmhurst/Coronahave a more conservative pronunciation,that is, one thatfollows moreclosely the orthographyof the language. For example, they are careful to say /nada/ instead of the common /na/. This is also an interestingfinding. Speakersare aware of regionalisms, however, in their oral interactionsthey rarely abandonthem. Yet, their pronunciationis readily affected. They mayheartheirColombianneighborreferto a bus as autobusinstead of guagua, but they will continue using the Caribbeanguagua. Yet, they will imitatethe more conservativephonology of their Colombianneighbors.
We asked some very conservative speakers of Dominican Spanish in Elmhurst/Coronawhy their pronunciationwas so conservative. They claimed this was "la pronunciacioncorrecta." We were surprisedthat some of these very conservativespeakerswere from El Cibao, a region in the DominicanRepublic thatis well knownfor the palatizationof Irl or substitutionof /y/ for Irl. When asked aboutthe use of poique for porque among Cibaeiios, they were quick to tell us that this was the wrong pronunciation.However, when asked about the use of auyamafor calabaza 'pumpkin',they said thatauyamawas correctand it was simply the way it was said in the Dominican Republic. As seen before, phonologyis muchmoreaffectedby contactwith otherSpanish-speakinggroups than lexicon.
Educatedspeakersof DominicanSpanishin the United States seem to hold on to regionalisms much more readily than to a radical pronunciation.This linguistic patternalso responds to distinctions of social class. Whereas in the DominicanRepublicall Dominicansregardlessof social class say chichigua for cometa 'kite', the moreeducatedDominicanshave a more conservativepronunciationeven back home. Regionalismsdo not distinguisheducatedfrom uneducatedspeakers,however, a very radicalpronunciationcharacterizesone as being uneducated.

In the Dominican Republic most of the populationare radical speakers of Spanish. Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronaoften come into contact with South AmericansandCentralAmericanswho have highlyconservativepronunciations. As the optionsof literacyin Spanishin an Anglo society are reducedand as the possibility of speaking English increases, we can expect that English may become an importantoption to escape linguistic prejudice.
The sociolinguistic isolation of Dominicans in WashingtonHeights reduces their linguistic options even furtherthan those of their compatriots in Elmhurst/Corona.On the one hand, theirSpanishhas little opportunityfor development in a society thatdoes not recognize it. On the other, there are simply not enough ESL classes in the area to meet the great English language needs of Dominicans. Unfortunately,even when classes are available, they most often take the wrong educationalapproach.Those whom we interviewedtold us that there are free ESL classes in churches, neighborhoodschools, a neighborhood college, and the community agency, but that they all have long waiting lists. Otherstold us thatthey had attendedEnglish classes and thatthey just couldn't learn.
On the whole, one senses a greatlinguistic frustrationin WashingtonHeights that one does not experience in Elmhurst/Corona. Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronahave more opportunityto interactin English in the community. The community becomes the classroom. Dominicans in Washington Heights rarely need to speak English to function within their community. They need effective English languageeducationalprogramsdesperately.Even thoughthey get along very well in Spanish, they often blame theirlack of English skills for their lot. They feel incompetentand ignorant, and they blame themselves for their incapacity, ratherthan accusing a system that does not give them the opportunityto attend effective English classes or escape from the linguistic isolationof the community.
Language attitudes
Table 15 revealsagainthe greatunanimitythatthereis among Dominicanswith regardsto the importanceof English, Spanish, and the teaching of Spanish in school.
Although Dominicans in both communities overwhelmingly reportto be in favor of having schools teach in Spanish, our interviews revealed a different realityin the schoolingpracticesof the two communities.Mostof the Dominican residentsof WashingtonHeights send their childrento the overcrowdedpublic schools of District6. Withthe exceptionof one school in the District,the restof the schools have highly transitionalbilingual programsonly for the newly arrived. Most of the parentswe interviewedreportedthattheirchildrenwere not getting any Spanish classes. At least four of those we interviewed send their childrento a special afterschoolprogramin Spanishreadingandwritingin one of the communityagencies.

the schools. When we asked them whetherthere were Dominicanand Hispanic teachersin the schools, they told us there were. The problem, however, is that given the huge numberof Dominican childrenin the schools, there simply are not enough Hispanic teachersor programsfor their children. Some expressed hope thatthe recent election of a Dominicancommunityresidentto the School Board might change the situationin the future.3When we pressed the parents about the reason for their discontent, it turnsout that they were rarely talking aboutthe lack of Spanishin the schools. The source of theirdissatisfactionwas most often the overcrowdingof classes, the contemptof the teachersand administratorsfor the community,the apathyof the teachers, and the lack of cafeteria and gym facilities.
The Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronaare much more satisfied with their schools. Parentsreportsending the childrenboth to the two public schools and the two parochialschools in the area. The many who told us thatthey send the childrento parochialschools were proudto pointout the presenceof two Dominican teachersthere. Their children, like those in WashingtonHeights, were not getting Spanish language classes in the schools. However, especially the parochial school parentswere satisfied with the educationtheirchildrenwere getting and with the way that Dominicanchildrenwere treatedin those schools.
NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ETHNIC COMMUNITY?
A comparisonof Dominicans in Washington Heights and Elmhurstyields interestingdifferencesregardingthe residentsof one nationalgroupin two socially differentcommunities.

noma in Santo Domingo. He is taking English lessons and he feels that in the futurehe will get a job "porque aqu( todo el mundo trabaja" 'because here everybody works'. This is a very differentattitudefrom that expressed by the unemployedin WashingtonHeights. "Aquid,"one young man told us, "es muy dificil conseguir trabajo" 'Here it's very difficult to get a job'.
This differenceis also clearly felt with regardto languageproficiency, behavior, and attitude.The more English languagesurroundof Elmhurst/Coronacreates differences that go beyond nationality. Thus, Dominicans in Elmhurst/Coronaare more proficient in English, use English more, especially in public, aremoreconcernedwith the literaryvalues of EnglishthanSpanish,and areslightlyless concernedwith havingschools teachin Spanish.The presenceof Englishin theirlanguagesurround,even when theirimmediateone functionsin Spanish, becomes very important.
Nationalitygroupsmay shareways of speakingand rules of linguistic codes. In the privacyof their homes, linguistic minoritiesof the same nationalorigin may behave similarly. But in public, linguistic minoritiesrespond to the language surroundin which they are immersed. Minority language use is mostly linkedto the sociofunctionalneed andthe social statusof thatlanguagewithina given speech community.

CONCLUSIONS
This article has focused on differences and contrastsof two Hispanic speech communities made up of five Hispanic national origin groups with regardto languageproficiency,languageuse, andlanguageattitudes.The most interesting resultof our research,however, is the greatcohesion thatexists in the Hispanic communityin the United States with regardto linguistic proficiency, language use, and language attitudes. Communitieswith differences in social class and ethnic composition, as well as different Hispanic nationalorigin groups, have greatinterestin speakingEnglishwell, greatloyaltytowardSpanishas the means of communicationwith others in the country of origin and the family in the United States and as a resourcefor the ethnic community, and great desire to havethe schools teachSpanishto theirchildren.All Hispanics- wealthy, middle class, or poor; educated or uneducated;young or old; blue collar workers or professionals;monolingualor bilingual - use Spanish extensively at home to speak with family and in the individualact of reading.
The Hispaniccommunitiesthatwe studiedaretoo recentfor us to argueabout diglossia or even to make predictionsabout Spanish language maintenanceor languageshift. Most of those we interviewedare Spanishmonolinguals,clearly with linguisticneed for Spanishin orderto communicateeffectively. Mostof the bilingualswe interviewedhadlearnedEnglishin schools in the countryof origin. Thus, theirlinguisticbehaviorand attitudesvis-a-vis bilingualismare shapedby

the notionsof elite bilingualismwhich they bringfrom the countryof origin, as well as by the prejudicetoward folk bilingualism which they encounterin the United States.
It is clearto us thatthe Hispanicswe interviewedfeel thattheirmajorobstacle in the United States is the lack of majoritysupportfor their community's bilingual use of Spanish and English. Those who speak only Spanish dream of speakingEnglishwell. However, ESL educationalprogramsthatuse Spanishto give meaningto English are rarein the United States. Most teachersof foreign languagesfor the elite use English to teach the target language. Yet, for poor Hispanics, the approachis consideredsuspect. Inadequateand scarce ESL programsin these communitiescannotteach English effectively. The communities are not given the opportunityto learn English, and at the same time they are robbedof their self-esteem as speakersof Spanish in the United States.
For middle-class Hispanics schooled in English in the countryof origin the situationis not much different. Although they come as speakers of a prestige dialectof Spanishhavingadequateknowledge of English for a Spanish-speaking country, they quickly become speakersof a stigmatized language with inadequate knowledge of English. Without any societal supportfor Spanish in the UnitedStates, these middle-classHispanicsface a similarlinguistic lot to poorer Hispanics.Thatis, they increasinglylose the use of Spanish, while not learning English fast enough.
The Hispanicswhom we interviewedhave a differentsense of linguistic present and future, and of their own and their children's linguistic needs. For the present, and for themselves, monolingualspeakersof Spanish want more programsof instructionin English using Spanishas a resourceto give them meaning. They also express the need to have majority approvalof their linguistic situation. They ask for the majority'stolerance of their limited knowledge of English and their need to use Spanish for communication. Bilingual speakers also expressdiscontentaboutthe linguisticprejudicethey experiencebecause of their accents, their mispronunciations,their incorrectgrammar.The attitudeof all is one of acceptanceof theirlinguisticpresentwith little hope of any possible change within their communityin this generation.However, they express hope that changes in the attitudeof the majoritytowardbilingualism and the use of Spanishwill amelioratetheir lives in the United States in the present.
For the future,and for theirchildren,however, the Hispanicswe interviewed wantmoreprogramsof instructionin Spanish.The Spanishprogramsareneeded in orderto insure the maintenanceof Spanish in the home. But they are also neededin orderto raisethe prestigeandstatusof Spanishin the UnitedStatesand improve the parents' lives in accented English or Spanish. The community understandsthat their childrenwill be native English speakers. However, they feel that unless U.S. society approves of Spanish-Englishbilingualism, their bilingualchildrenwill face the same educationalandsocial neglect thatthey, the parents,feel now.
