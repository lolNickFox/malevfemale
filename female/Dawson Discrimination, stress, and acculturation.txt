Researchers have well established the association between discriminatory experiences, life chances, and mental health outcomes among Latino/as, especially among Mexican Americans. However, few studies have focused on the impact of stress or the moderating effects of low acculturation levels among recent immigrants, such as Dominicans. Using the transactional stress model, the present community-based study examines the relationship between discrimination and stress, and whether this association varies by low acculturation levels in a sample of 246 Dominican women. Results indicate a positive relationship between major racist events (e.g., job-related discrimination), everyday discrimination (e.g., not receiving services in a store), and stress levels. Furthermore, low acculturation moderated the impact that discriminatory experiences had on the stress level of Dominican women. Implications for further research on discrimination and stress among Dominican immigrants are discussed.

Social scientists have well established the stressful nature of discriminatory events and the negative impact of discrimination on the life chances, mental health, and health of Latino/as (for review, see Araujo & Borrell, 2006). For example, Latino/as who experience discrimination have been documented as earning lower wages, having lower prestige jobs, and higher rates of depression (Murguia & Telles, 1996; Ramos, Jaccard, & Guilamo-Ramos, 2003; Ryff, Keyes, & Hughes, 2003; Stuber, Galea, Ahern, Blaney, & Fuller, 2003). Unfortunately, there is limited evidence on

the association between discrimination and stress among more recent Latino/a immigrants, such as Dominicans, who represent a racially diverse group with less education than earlier waves of Dominican immigrants (Hernandez & Rivera-Batiz, 2003).
Despite the negative impact of discriminatory events, Latino/as possess culturally relevant protective factors that can mediate the impact of negative experiences (Burnam, Hough, Karno, Escobar, & Telles, 1987; Cuellar, 1997; Heilemann, Lee, Kury, & Salvador, 2002). For instance, factors such as lighter skin color, higher socioeconomic and immigration status have been identified as diminishing the negative affects of such discriminatory events (Alegria et al., 2008; Portes & Rumbaut, 1996). Additionally, low acculturation, which refers to adherence to the cultural values of one's home country versus that of the new host culture (Breslau et al., 2007; Burnam et al., 1987), has been associated with lower stress levels. This finding is based on the premise that adherence to Latino/a culture provides individuals with a sense of belonging and a supportive network that can protect them from negative experiences such as discrimination (Berry, Kim, Power, Young, & Bujaki, 1989). One study found that Latino/as with low levels of acculturation had lower stress levels as well as better mental health outcomes (Breslau et al., 2007). In this regard, Dominicans present a unique group in which to study the aforementioned premise because they tend to be less acculturated, as evidenced by their high rates of Spanish language dominance, even by the third generation (Alba, 2005). The present study posits that low acculturation levels operate as a protective factor against the negative impact of discriminatory experiences on stress levels among Dominican immigrant women.
Conceptual Framework: Discrimination and Stress
Discrimination as a stressor is conceptualized as consisting of differential treatment or denial of opportunities (i.e., education, employment, housing) based on group membership (Allport, 1954, 1979; Feagin & Eckberg, 1980). In the literature, researchers have distinguished between chronic discriminatory stressors such as everyday discrimination, and acute discriminatory stressors such as major racist events (Gardner, 1995; Harrell, 2000; Williams, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2003; Williams, Yu, Jackson, & Anderson, 1997). Daily racial hassles refer to everyday racist events, including subtle or overt acts of discrimination or exclusion such as not receiving service in a restaurant (Essed, 1990; Feagin & Feagin, 1986, Gardner, 1995; Harrell, 2000). Acute discriminatory stressors (major racist

events) occur sporadically throughout one's life, affecting various areas such as employment or housing) (Feagin, 2001; Harrell, 2000; Williams et al., 1997, 2003). Both types of discrimination have been associated with higher stress levels.
According to Lazarus and Folkman's (1989a) transactional stress model, stress develops as a result of the interaction between the person and environment, as well as the coping resources individuals use to deal with the event. Therefore, experiencing discriminatory events translates into stress depending on the appraisal of the event by the individual (Cronkite & Moos, 1984; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984b; Wheaton, 1999). Individuals who have protective factors in place do not experience stress, while those who lack the sufficient resources to cope with such events may experience stress. Existing evidence supports the association between discriminatory events and stress levels among African Americans (Aneshensel & Frerichs, 1982; Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1973; Jackson et al., 1999; Sellers, Caldwell, Schmeelk-Cone, & Zimmerman, 2003), but there is a paucity of research focusing on Latino/as.
Discrimination and Stress Among Dominicans/Latino/as
Because Dominicans and other Latino/as represent a racially and ethnically diverse group, they are likely targets of discrimination in the United States (Rodriguez, 2001; Torres-Saillant & Hernandez, 1999). For instance, racially, Dominicans can be perceived as African American based on their dark complexions, while ethnically they are Latino/a and speak Spanish (Duany, 1996; Gomez, 2000; Torres-Salliant & Hernandez, 1999). These characteristics can expose Dominicans and other Latino/as to increased rates of discriminatory experiences.
Similar to African Americans, the general discrimination literature supports the association between discrimination and poor mental health among Latino/as (Araujo & Borrell, 2006; Finch, Kolody, & Vega, 2000; Falcon & Tucker, 2000; Ramos et al., 2003; Salgado de Snyder, 1987). For example, Salgado de Snyder (1987) found that Mexican women that experienced discrimination had higher depression rates than women who reported not experiencing discrimination. Another study found a positive association between discrimination and depression among Black Latinas compared to African American, Latino/a, and White adolescents (Ramos et al., 2003). Despite these research efforts, to date there is only one study that has focused on the association between discrimination and stress among women. For example, Amaro, Russo, and Johnson (1987) found that 84%

of Latina professionals reported experiencing discrimination, and that discrimination was significantly related to stress. The present study attempts to fill the void in the existing literature.
Acculturation Level as a Protective Factor
Interestingly, despite the negative impact of discrimination, not all Latino/as are adversely affected by such events. It has been argued that low acculturation levels have not only been associated with adherence to the cultural values and behaviors of one's home culture, but they have also been found to protect the mental health and stress outcomes of individuals when they experience negative events (Burnam et al., 1987; Cuellar, 1997; Cuellar & Roberts, 1984; Heilemann et al., 2002). In general, acculturation, defined as a shift in cultural values that occurs when individuals come into contact with a new culture (Berry, 1980, 1995; Rogler, Cortes, & Malgadi, 1991), may expose Latino/as to more contact with individuals in the dominant culture, and contribute to their adaptation to U.S. cultural values and language (Berry, 1980; Padilla & Perez, 2001). On the other hand, Padilla (1995) argues that although Latino/as in the United States feel pressured to adapt and assimilate to mainstream behaviors, their experiences of discrimination may result in many Latino/as seeking comfort in their home culture. Therefore it is plausible that discriminatory experiences among Latino/as actually strengthens their cultural ties and therefore helps to protect them from discriminatory experiences.
Existing evidence supports the association between acculturation levels and mental health outcomes among Latino/as (Breslau et al., 2007; Heilemann et al., 2002). For example, less acculturated Mexican women have been found to display lower rates of depression than women who had spent most of their childhood in the United States (Heilemann et al., 2002). This relationship is based on the premise that cultural connections and low acculturation levels provide individuals with a sense of ethnic identity and support, and therefore can serve as a protective factor (Breslau et al., 2007). Unfortunately, there is a dearth of research focusing on stress among more recent Latino/as such as Dominicans.
It appears that acculturation theory may help our understanding of the experiences of Dominican immigrant women who primarily settle in U.S. ethnic enclaves or travel to the United States to reunite with family members (Torres-Saillant & Hernandez, 1999). For example, in 2000, Dominican women made up 54.7% of the Dominican population in the United States and settled primarily in ethnic enclaves or Latino/a-concentrated areas such as the

Washington Heights area in New York City (Gilbertson, 1995; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). Studies suggest that Dominicans resist acculturation, creating neighborhoods in which they can maintain and cultivate their home culture in the United States (Duany, 1998; Pessar, 1995). Considering that Dominicans primarily occupy Spanish-speaking ethnic enclaves and travel frequently to visit the Dominican Republic (Garcia Coll & Schlaza, 2004), the present article posits that maintaining low acculturation levels by engaging in activities such as (retaining) Spanish as their primary language and preserving or sustaining their cultural ties helps to insulate Dominicans from discriminatory experiences. To date, researchers have not examined the role of low acculturation status, specifically among Dominican women.
The purpose of this study is twofold: (a) to determine the stressful impact of discriminatory experiences among a community sample of Dominican immigrants in New York City, before and after controlling for age, years lived in the United States, employment, income and level of education; and (b) to investigate whether the associations among stress, major racist events, and everyday discrimination vary by low acculturation level.
Method
Participants
A convenience sample of 246 adult Dominican immigrant women from a predominantly Dominican neighborhood in New York City were recruited from four community program sites to participate in an hourlong survey. Participants had to be born in the Dominican Republic and have migrated to the United States after the age of 18. Participants were offered a $10 cash gift as compensation for their participation in the study. Each participant was given the opportunity to complete the survey in Spanish or English. All participants (100%) chose to complete the survey in Spanish.
Measures
Because the measures used in the present study were not available in Spanish (with the exception of the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale [BAS]), the measures were translated into Spanish by a professional translator and then were back-translated by a second translator.

Stress. The Hassles and Uplifts Scale (HUS) is a 53-item measure of hassles that consists of daily reoccurring events that range from minor annoyances to major pressures, problems, and difficulties (Kanner, Coyne, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1981). The scale consists of items relating to health, relationships, personal habits, finances, chores, and viewpoints on the outside world. Respondents are asked to indicate the hassles they have experienced in the past 12 months and rate how severe each hassle has been on a 4-point scale (0 = does not apply to 3 = majority of the time). Possible scores range from 0 to 159, higher scores signifying higher levels of stress. The mean score for the Hassles frequency score consists of a simple count of the number of items checked. The internal reliability for the scale items was .93 in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies that have yielded test/retest reliabilities of .95 (Kanner et al., 1981).
Independent Variables
The Major Racist Events (MRE; Williams et al., 1997) scale consists of six items on discrimination in the areas of employment, housing, and education (e.g., Do you think you have ever been unfairly fired or denied a promotion?). Each item was dichotomously coded "yes" or "no." Scores ranged from 0 to 6, with higher scores denoting higher rates of discrimination. For our sample, the Cronbach alpha for the scale items was .73.
Everyday discrimination. Daily Racial Hassles (DRH) is a subscale of the Racism and Life Experiences scales developed by Harrell (1997). The DRH is a self-report measure that assesses the frequency of occurrence of 18 microaggressions due to race in the past year. For this study, the scale was modified to specifically measure events that occurred due to being "Dominican" (e.g., How often have you been ignored or not received a service in a restaurant because you are Dominican?). The frequency of the hassles is assessed using a 6-point Likert-type scale that ranges from 0 (never experienced) to 5 (several times a week) with higher scores indicating more discrimination. A score for the DRH scale was obtained by calculating the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each item. The internal reliability for the scale items was .91 for the sample, which is consistent with previous studies that have yielded test/retest reliability of .90 (Harrell, 1997).

Covariates
Demographic variables. Age was collected as continuous and recoded as a categorical variable (1 = 18-29, 2 = 30-49, 3 = 50-69, and 4 = 70-90). Education was coded either as no educational background, elementary school, middle school, high school, college, or graduate school. Household income was measured in the last year and was recoded into five categories (1 = $0-$5000, 2 = $5001-$10,000, 3 = $10,001-$20,000, 4 = $20,000$30,000, or 5 = $40,001 and up [there were no households earning $30,001 and more]). Years in the United States was coded as follows: 1 = 11-20, 2 = 21-30, and 3 = 31-40.
Acculturation. The BAS consists of two subscales consisting of 12 items, the low (Hispanic Domain) and high acculturation (non-Hispanic Domain) subscales, which ask participants to rate their proficiency in English and Spanish regarding linguistic proficiency and media language preferences (e.g., How often do you watch television in Spanish; Marin & Gamba, 1996). Media items were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always), while linguistic proficiency items were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (very bad) to 4 (very good).
The score for each domain was obtained by averaging across items for each subscale. Each participant was assigned two scores, which could range from 1 to 4; one unit was then subtracted from the final score so that each variable could have a possible zero point (a recommended strategy in moderation analyses). Consequently, the high acculturation (non-Hispanic Domain subscale ranged from 0 to 3, while the low acculturation subscale (Hispanic Domain) ranged from 0.73 to 3. The BAS model works under the premise that acquiring the values of one culture does not mean a decrease in adherence to the other. Individuals that are both low and high in acculturation are considered bicultural. The internal reliability for the high acculturation subscale items was .95, which is consistent with previous studies that have yielded test/retest reliability of .97 (Marin & Gamba, 1996). The internal reliability for the low acculturation subscale was .77, which is lower than previous studies that have yielded .93 but still considered an acceptable reliability.
Statistical Analyses
About one-third of the subjects in the sample were missing one or more of the variables used in the analysis. Generally, deletion of cases with missing data should be avoided unless the missing values can be

shown to be missing completely at random (MCAR). A chi-square test for MCAR demonstrated that this was not the case (Little, 1988). Consequently, deletion of these cases might have caused substantial parameter bias. In order to reduce any bias that may have been caused by not knowing the values of the missing data, a strategy known as multiple imputation (MI) was used (Schafer, 1997). A model was developed for generating conditional probability distributions for the missing values, from which random draws were made. This process was repeated five times using SAS Proc MI, creating five versions of the data, each of which was subjected to the analysis. The five sets of estimates were combined according to specific rules, implemented in SAS Proc MIAnalyze, that account for the uncertainty of the randomly drawn values (Little & Rubin, 2002), thereby resulting in a complete data set for this study.
Descriptive statistics for the study population were yielded; and descriptive statistics for the scales used in the analysis were presented (see Table 1). Linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationship of major racist events and everyday discrimination with stress before and after controlling for selected covariates. Each model was estimated in two stages: in the first stage, each covariate was entered, along with either major racist events or everyday discrimination, and with the acculturation variables. To determine whether the association of major racist events, everyday discrimination and stress vary by acculturation levels, an interaction was tested in the second stage. Two interaction terms, major racist events and acculturation and everyday discrimination and acculturation were tested in the final models (Aiken & West, 1991). All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1. All p values presented are two-sided. Standardized betas were calculated for each parameter estimate.
Results
Sample Profile
Most participants were between the ages of 30 and 49 years (61.8%) and resided in the United States for 11 to 20 years (68.9%), half the participants had completed high school (50.8%), 65.2% were not employed, and twothirds earned less than $10,000 a year.
Participants reported a mean of 0.09 of major racist events (SD = 0.18, range = 0-1) and 0.60 of everyday discrimination (SD = 0.65, range = 0-5;

Table 1). Regarding stress, participants yielded a mean of 1.19 (SD = 0.73, range = 0-3). Most participants reported being low in acculturation (Hispanic Domain; M = 2.60, SD = 0.40, range = 0.73-3), and were less likely to be high in acculturation (non-Hispanic Domain; M = 0.91, SD = 0.71, range = 0-3). Participants who were high in acculturation (above the median level for the sample) were, on average, significantly younger (14% less than 30 years vs. 4% for low acculturation, and 2% older than 70 years vs. 8% for low acculturation), twice as likely to be employed (48% vs. 24%), and had higher income (13% having income between $20,001 and 30,000, vs. 6% for low acculturation, and 33% less than $5,000 vs. 51% for low acculturation). Otherwise they were not significantly different.
Regression analyses was conducted to assess the relationship between stress, major racist events, everyday discrimination, as well as the moderating effect of acculturation, while controlling for sociodemographic variables such as age, time in the United States, employment status, and income, which were also entered into the model as control variables. The level of significance was set at p < .01**. In the first regression analyses, Major racist events ( = 0.21**, SD = 0.18, p < .004) were significantly related to the stress variable. Specifically, Dominican women who report more experiences of major racist events report experiencing more stress.
In order to test the moderating effect of low acculturation on the relationship between major racist events and stress, an interaction term was entered in the fully adjusted model. However, the interaction term was not significant.
In the second regression analyses, stress, everyday discrimination, and the control variables were entered into the regression simultaneously. Everyday discrimination ( = 0.21**, SD = .65, p < .003) was significantly related to stress. The findings indicate that daily experiences of discrimination are positively related to stress.

In order to investigate the moderating effect of low acculturation levels on the relationship between stress and everyday discrimination, an interaction term was entered into the model separately. This interaction term tested the assumption that low acculturation level acts as a protective factor and can alter the impact that discriminatory experiences have on stress levels. The interaction term between low acculturation (Hispanic Domain) and everyday discrimination was significantly related to stress ( = 1.05, p < .05) suggesting that greater adherence to Latino/a culture moderated the negative association between everyday discrimination and stress levels, with low acculturation levels being associated with a diminished negative effect of everyday discrimination. The addition of the interaction term appears to alter the relationship between the marginal term for everyday discrimination (changing from 0.21 to -0.81), but this is understood to derive from the marginal beta being interpreted where low acculturation (Hispanic Domain) subscale = 0 in the interaction model, whereas in the no-interaction model, no such state dependence is necessary; the beta in the no-interaction model being an average effect over all values of low acculturation (Hispanic Domain) subscale (Aiken & West, 1991).
Discussion/Implications
This study examined the relationship between experiences of discrimination and stress, as well as low acculturation levels as a protective factor in a sample of Dominican immigrant women. Findings supported the hypothesis that discriminatory experiences are related to stress levels among Dominican women. More specifically, women who experienced major racist events (e.g., educational discrimination) and everyday discrimination (e.g., being harassed in a store) exhibited higher stress levels. The aforementioned findings are consistent with the work of Finch et al. (2000), which has identified discriminatory experiences as stressful events among Latino/as and more importantly provides support for the positive association between discriminatory experiences and stress among Dominican women who are an understudied population.
Based on the unique cultural retention among Dominicans (Alba, 2005), we expected low acculturation levels to moderate the impact of discriminatory experiences on stress levels, which was supported by the findings. Therefore, cultural maintenance among Dominicans and other Latino/as can be beneficial and provide individuals with culturally based protective factors against stressful events such as discrimination. This is not surprising

considering that recent waves of Latino/a immigrants such as Dominicans, are participating in transnational activities, which facilitates their connection to their home country and cultural practices (Itzigsohn, Giorguli, & Vazquez, 2005). These cultural connections may inherently help them cope with U.S.based discrimination. In fact, it has been posited that the cultural adherence among Latino/as in the United States may be in response to discriminatory experiences; and therefore discrimination may serve to increase cultural ties (Padilla, 2008).
Unexpectedly, the results also revealed that both low and high acculturation levels were significantly related to stress. Although this is an unexpected finding, it is consistent with previous analyses, which has linked both low (Rogler et al., 1991) and high acculturation levels with stress outcomes (Breslau et al., 2007). Several researchers have posited that individuals low in acculturation experience stress due to lack of support and loss of cultural connections (Rogler et al., 1991); while those high in acculturation may exhibit higher stress levels due to loss of cultural protective factors (Vega et al., 1998). Additionally, it as been argued that biculturalism (adherence to both the home and host society's culture) has psychological advantages, versus low and high acculturation levels for Latino/as (Padilla, 1995, 2002, chap. 3). Perhaps the next steps in this line of research are to investigate the advantages of biculturalism among Dominican immigrants in addition to the benefits of low acculturation.
The results of this study must be interpreted with caution due to the nonexperimental design and missing data, and the fact that a comparison group was not included. Therefore the present findings cannot be generalized to the overall Dominican population due to the uniqueness of the present sample. Despite the limitations, the results do reveal interesting trends among a Dominican immigrant population that resides in an ethnic enclave. One major contribution of the present study is the empirical evidence regarding the association between discriminatory experiences and stress among an understudied population of recent Latina immigrants. Most discriminatory research among Latino/as has focused on Mexicans and less on Caribbean populations, as well as mental health outcomes (for review, see Araujo & Borrell, 2006). It is important to consider that Latino/a populations, such as Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominicans, have varied immigration histories and patterns, and evidence from one group should not be generalized to another (Moscicki, Rae, Regier, & Locke, 1987). This area of research is especially important considering that Dominicans and other Latino/as represent likely targets of discrimination due to their racial diversity (Rodriguez, 2001); and it can negatively affect their stress outcomes. Such

information would help identify the discriminatory experiences of this growing population and increase the knowledge base of the prevalence of discriminatory events among more recent waves of Latino/a populations.
Interestingly, another area that warrants further investigation is the use of discrimination measures that identify who targets Latino/as or discriminates against this growing population. For example, the present sample resided in an ethnic enclave and were primarily Spanish-speaking, therefore it is plausible that most of their interactions were with other Latinos/as and or/African Americans. This idea supports recent findings of a national study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Research Center (2004) with a sample of 4,213 Latinos in New York (54%), New Jersey (55%), California (50%), and Texas (47%) who felt that Latino/as discriminating against Latino/as was an issue.
Another contribution of the present study was empirical evidence regarding the acculturation levels of Dominican immigrants. Regardless of time in the United States, the present sample was low in acculturation, which is consistent with the existing information on the Dominican population, which has described them as a mostly Spanish speaking group (Alba, 2005). Although acculturation theorists posit that increased contact with the dominant culture contributes to adaptation to the cultural values and language of the dominant society (Padilla & Perez, 2001), this may not be applicable to Dominican immigrants. Although the present study did not support the idea that low acculturation served as a protective factor against discriminatory events, future research should continue to examine the role of low acculturation among Dominicans.
In conclusion, this study provides empirical evidence that discrimination negatively affects the stress levels of Dominican immigrant women. Despite this contribution, additional research examining the discrimination experiences of Dominican and other understudied Latino/a populations is needed; as well as the importance of acculturation levels for more recent Latino/a immigrants such as Dominicans. Research of this nature will inform researchers, practitioners, and policy makers of the impact of discriminatory experiences on the stress levels of Dominican immigrants and other Latino/as in the United States. Research in these areas is of great importance in order to inform fields such as social work and increase effective programs and interventions with this growing population.
