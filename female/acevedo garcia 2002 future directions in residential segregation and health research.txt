Future Directions in Residential Segregation and Health Research: A Multilevel Approach

The authors examine the research evidence on the effect of residential segregation on health, identify research gaps, and propose new research directions.
Four recommendations are made on the basis of a review of the sociological and social epidemiology literature on residentiai segregation: (1) develop multilevel research designs to examine the effects of individual, neighborhood. and metropolitan-area factors on health outcomes; (2) continue examining the health effects of residential segregation among African Americans but also initiate studies examining segregation among Hispanics and Asians; (3) consider racial/ethnic segregation along with income segregation and other metropolitan area factors such as poverty concentration and metropolitan governance fragmentation; and (4) develop better conceptual frameworks of the pathways that may link various segregation dimensions to specific health outcomes.

SOCIOLOGY OF RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION
Residential Segregation and Racial/Ethnic Discrimination
The US sociological literature suggests that rx;sidential segrega-

tion along racial/ethnic lines is not primarily a result of the residential preferences of riunonty groups. National and metropolitan area siuTeys have show^n that, on average, African Amencaiis and llisparucs would be more willing than Whites to live ill relatively integrateil iieigliborhoods,'' ''' On the other hand, several stiidies, including audit studies involving expenmental designs, have indicated that Alrican Americans and Ilispanics continue to face dLscrimination in housing and mortgage niarkcts even after income has been controlleti.''^"' Discrimination [jrevents upwardly mobile mcmbei-s of minority groups from becoming more spatially integrated with
Residential Segregation by Race/Ethnicity vs Income
Conceivably, racial/c'thnic rcjsidential segregation could be a reflection of Ihe large socioeconomic status (SES) gaps that exist between members of US minority g!"oups and Whites at the intlividuai level, llowever. this does not appear to be the case.'*" The available evidence indicates that segregation by race/etimicity is sti-onger than segregation by income; that is, race and ethnicity sort individuals of comparable SHS into vastly different neighborhood environnienLs. In 1980 and 1990. income segregation reached only '*moderate" levels,'" Conversely, m the same years, African /\merican segi^ega-

tion was ai a "high" level (arcording to accepted sociol(>gii:al de(initions).''
Residential Segregation and Poverty Concentration
A highly significani i.ssue in tlie sociological litcraiure is v>'hether the increasing concentrations of neighborhood piivc'riy documented .since the U>7ils can be primarily attribmed to the high levels of residential segipgation experienced by members of minority gi'oups. to ecoinjoiic factors (e.g., increasing income inequality), or to the mici'action of segregation and economic \'-actoi-s.^''-'-'Using 1970 to 1990 census data for (JO metropolitan areas, Masisey and F^ischei"-' showed that inleractions between residential segi^egatiois and income inequality were exhibiting strong effects on the spatial isolation of the [)oor by 1990.
Dimensions of Segregation Fiesidentitii segregation refers
to segregation in ]-t::gard to the composition and spatial distribution of the po[)ulatioii oi an entire metropolitan area across its neighborhoods: thus, rc'Sidtnitial segregation is a multilevel concept that combines mtbrmalion on 2 geographic scales.

Income Segregation and Other Metropolitan Area Variables
Because o!' the preeminent status of racial/ethnic segregation, US research has focused on Ihe relaiionshi]) between i.his iype of segregation (as opposed to income ss'gregafion) and health outcomes Among the stu(iies reviewed hfire, only 2 examineti income residential segregation'''''^ and found it to be positively assoiriated with mortality. However, ihese studies examined mortality only among all racial/ ethnic groups combin(;d (rather than mortality i-ates according to race/t'thni(-ity), and they did not exainine racial/ethnic segregation vis-a-vis income segregation. Cooper et al,'' analyzed tfie rok'S of (race-specjlic.) income inequality and racial segregation iind found that, m tlie case of Aflicaii Americans, both variables were positively associatetJ with mortality.
Studies of segregation and health have focused little attention on other characteristics nl' the spatial organization of metropolitan Aff/as. Only 2 of the studies * ' n^viewed examined the role of residential .segregation vis-a-vis olher metropolitan-l

processes. TIart et al,""' showed that metropolitan ai-eas characterized by metropolitan governance forms had lower Black mortality rates than metropolitan areas cJiaracterized by municipal fi-agmentation and that residential segregation mediated the etfcet of metropolitan governance on Black male mortality. Peterson anci Knvo'' found that concentrated disadvantage (measured via an average of 4 exposure indexes) mediated the effect of segi-egation on Black, homicide rates.
Segregation Dimensions Most of the studies reviewed
involved the use of segregation indexes described in the sociological literature. However, health research has largely overlooked the complexity of residential segregation. In general, most of our sample of studies included only dissimilarity indexes and lacked a conceptual justification for focusing on this segregation dimension.
Keseareh has only recently begun Io address the relationship between health outcomes and segregation dimensions other than dissimilarity.'^"*''*' In several of the present studies, isolation indexes were used, providing a conceptual justification for focusing on this dimension,^''*''*'*'*'^ For example, Shihadf^h and Flynn''* hypothesized that because Black isolation concentrates multiple disadvantages into a single ecological space, it would be positively associated with Black homicifie rates. Only a few studies have involved other measures of segregation, such as centralization^" and concentration. '*' Similarly, few studies have addressed the issue of

Pathways Between

Residentiai Segregation

and Health

Studies focusing on segrega-

tion and health have mcoipo-

rated a fi^amework that is largely

based on the sociological evi-

dence relating segi-egation to tlie

formation of exh-emely different

neighborhood environments, ;LS

well as to restricted socioeco-

nomic opportunities i'or minority

individuals.

Tlierefore, in

general, it is hypothesized that

segi-egation affects health indi-

rectly through tjualitj' of neigh-

borhood environment concentra-

tion of poverty, or shaping of the

socioeconomic attainment of mi-

nority group members,'^'**''^'"'

However, most study designs

have not been suitable for testing

these pathways. Only one of the

stutlies reviewed'*' tested

whether poverty concenti'alions

mediate the effect of segregation

on health, while a few studies

misspeeified this pathway by con-

trolling for metropolitan aggre-

gate poverty rate as opposed to

poverty concentration (i.e.. racr;/

ethnicity-specific exposure to

poverty across neighborhoods).

No multilevel studies have ad-

dressed the relationship between

segregation and health through

the use of indicators of neighbor-

hood environment quality.

NEW DIRECTIONS IN SEGREGATION AND HEALTH RESEARCH

Current socjological reseai-ch underscores the continued significance of race in shaping inequality in urban areas.''^ In the heaKh field, there is increasing awareness and documentation of racial/ethnic, health disjjarities. Therefore, continued exploration of racial residential segregation iis a factor contributing to health

inequalities is cliarly warranted. The focus on segregation as an expre.ssion of iu,stitutioiial racism IS also warranted but, as discussed subsequentlv, could be strengthened with a multilevel framework and attention to other I'onus of urban inequality.
Multilevel Research Designs Segregation and health stud-
ies have mostly relied on aggregate data, and improving ecological research designs remains an important task (later we discuss possible extensions of previous studies), fiowcver, ecological studies cannot untangle the pathways, including metropolitan area, neighborhood- and individual-level factors, through which segregation may inlluence hi^alth.''' To date, the neighborhoods and bealth literature and the segregation and health literature have intersected only minimally.'"' Integrating these 2 lines of research into a multilevel framework may heip place neighborhoods in the context of their metropolitan areas, with the attending implications for social and public health policy.
Recent directions m urban inequality studies''^ and neigliborhoods and health research'"''*' suggest tlic potential, in terms of providing an understanding of tlie dynamics of health inequalities, of multilevel health surveys of household members from neighborhoods in s<!veral major metrojiolitan ar(.;as witli ^'arioiis types of racial/ethnic divei-siiy and segi-egaiioti patterns.

In the paragraphs lo follow, we prop(!se some mechanisms through which various segregation dimensions !na\' influence bealth.
Snqirisingly, tiespile Ibc' reliance on measures of dissimilarily iti h<'alth studies, Oiis is the segirgation dimension mvolving Ihe least cleaj- conceptual relevance for health outcomes.

Clustering of disadvantaged neighborhoods may further constrain .social and economic opportunities for tbe segregated gnjup. 'llie social {e.g., crime) and heaith effects of one's neighborhood of residence caii be mitigated or (jxacerbated depending on the soaoeconomie characteristics of the surrounding neighborhoods.'"^" ll! a metix)po]itim area with a high ie\'ei of racial/ ethnic "ghettoization," it may be more difficult for ghetto residents to access i:)tl"ier paits of the metnipolitan area in si^arch of, for example, retail outlets or sttcial and health services. Also, social groups at high risk for transmission of infectious diseases [e.g., sexually traiismitteci diseases) may cluster in "core" census
tracts'^*^*^"
The s|)read of infectious diseases from US mner-city disease epicenters to the surrounding suburbs may be a function of degree of centralization {e.g.. dispersal of poor populations from the central city).''"' A similar pattern of "diffusion" irom

central city epicenters to the surrounding areas exists in regard to other sociaJ and health outcomes as well, such as cnme and low birthwcight.*"'"' It remains to be tested whether this pattern responds to a spatial social gradient in tbe concentration of disadvantage from higher levels in central cities to lower levels in outer suburbs. In the case of (uitcomes that may respond to transmission/diffusion (e.g.. infectious diseases or crime), an alternative mechanism may be the interaction between central city and suburban residents.
Concentration or densi^' of marginalized populations may be an important detemiinant of infectious disease transmission,''"'^'' in that it may increase contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. High degrees of concentration {and isolation) of ethnic/racial minority groups or disadv;intagcd populations may also facilitate geographic targeting on the pail of anti--j^ublic health entities such as the tobacco and alcohol industiies."'*^^ Finally, m em|)irical terms, concentration is the segregation dimension most clearly linked to indicators of lower SS^S ainong African Americans.'"'

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A large body of sociological

and policy literature strongly

suggests that residentiai segrega-

tion has been a key factor in cre-

ating substantial inequalities in

opportunity across space {i.e.,

neighborhoods) and across indi-

viduals along racial/ethnic

lines. *

hcological

heaitii studies have shown that

segregation is positively associ-

ated with mortality rates and

certain health outcomes among Afncan Americans. However, only multilevel research designs will allow us to examine the effects of individual, neighborhood, and metropolitan area factors on health outcomes.
We should continue to address the health effects of residential segregation on African Arncficans but also initiate comparative studies examining segi'cgation oi' Hispanics and Asians. Racial/ethnic segregation is a key factor, but one that should be considered along with olher metropolitan area characteristics sueh as mcome segregation, poverty concentration, and mefropolitan governance fragmentation. It will also be important to develop better conceptual fi'ameworks ot the pathways that may link various segregation diinensions to specific health outcomes, *

Sick and lired of Being Sick and Tired: Scientific Evidence, Methods, and Research Implications for Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Occupational Health

rhe extent of racial/ethnic aisparities in occupational health have not been well studied. The author leviows the evidence about workers of color and occupational injuries and disease.
Patterns of employment in the U.S. workforce according to education, gender, and race/ethnicity are discussed, and how these patterns nifght cause disproportionate exposure leading to disproportion ale disease and injury. Methodological issues are explored that have hampered research about occupational heaith disparities, and future research needs are Identified. [Am J Public Heolth. 2003;93: 221-226)

I Linda Rae Murray, MD, N4PH
OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE and injury arc significant, if underappreciated, public health problems in the United States and worldwide!. Far too many US workers die on the job, despile the fact that the rate for occupational fatalities has fallen from 18 per 100 000 workers m 1970, when the Occupationa! Safety and Health Act was passed, to 4.3 per 100 000 workers in 2000.^ The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there were 5915 traumatic occupational fatalities in 2000, and over 6 million work-related injuries and illnesses were reported in the private and public sectors.' This means that for each day of 2000 more than 16 workers died on the job, and some 15 600 were injured or became ill in the private sector. There were 3(i2 500 newly reported cases oi' occupational illnesses

in private industry in 2000." Hstimates for annual deaths from work-related diseases is between 50 000 and 60 000 workers per year. The risk of injury and death is not evenly distributed. I'or example, although less than 3'V(i of the labor foree works on farms, farm workers have one of highest fatality rates, at 20 per 100 000 workers in 2000.'
Do occupational health disparities exist by class, race, and ethnicity? If so, what is their cause? Are there differential exposures lo occupational and environmental toxicants by class, race, and ethnicity? Are there differences in genetic susceptibility to occupational exposures? To what extent do other factors sueh as stress, iaek of access to medical care, and poor nutrition result in disparate work-related health outcomes?

PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE US WORKFORCE
The US workplace is a product of our social, economic, anfi cultural histoiy, and Ihereforc is littered with gender, racial, and ethnic "job ghettos." Workers of color generally are underreprcsented in profes,sionai categories and overrepresentcd in blue-collar and servicc jobs, especially in certain occupations. For example, in 1996 50% of all garbage collectors, over 33'^;o of all elevator operators, and 33'Vo of all nursing aides and orderlies were Blaek. Similarly, more that three-fourths of all miscellaneous woodworkers, 68"'o of all farm product graders and sorters, 37% oi'all farmworkers, and 34"'b of all fabric machine operators were Latino. Meanwhile, 97'Vo of all dental hygienists wore White;'
