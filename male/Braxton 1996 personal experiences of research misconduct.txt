Personal Experiences of Research Misconduct and the Response of
Individual Academic Scientists
John M. Braxton Vanderbilt University
Alan E. Bayer Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University
From a national U.S. sample of senior academic biochemists, ninety-four indicated that they personally knew of an incident of scientific wrongdoing. Among these individuals, less formal actions against an offending individual we re endorsed when either (1) actions were believed to have the potential to publicly embarrass the offending individual, or (2) the actions might adversely affect the professional career of the whistleblower. These relationships remain significant after controlling for professional status, career age, and current level of formal departmental administrative responsibility. Study limitations and implications are discussed
The lay public expects professional groups to maintain a degree of selfregulation so as to deter, detect, and impose sanctions on professional wrongdoing (Goode 1969). Over the last two decades anumber of highly publicized and prominent cases of scientific misconduct such as those of Baltimore, Bruening, Darsee, Imanishi-Kari, Slutsky, and Summerline have eroded the lay public's confidence in the mechanisms of social control in the academic profession in general and in the scientific community in particular (Braxton and Bayer 1994). In the United States, this erosion in public trust has prompted congressional oversight hearings on misconductin science (LaFollette 1994).
U.S. congressional concern has focused primarily on the manner in which universities had or had not investigated allegations of scientific impropriety

rather than on the fact that wrongdoing had occurred (LaFollette 1994). Put differently, the adequacy of social control of wrongdoing by the scientific community has been questioned, and as a consequence the Office of Research Integrity of the Public Health Service and the Office of Inspector General of the National Science Foundation were established by the U.S. Congress to investigate and impose sanctions on misconduct. Thus social control was discharged by the U.S. Congress (Fox and Braxton 1994; Hackett 1994). Moreover, in response to requirements issued by these offices of the federal government, the majority of U.S. research universities have developed policies and procedures for investigating charges of misconduct (Steneck 1994). Nevertheless, the detection of misconduct-and the imposition of sanctions on misconduct-by universities remains problematic. Universities have strong sanctions available for disciplining scientific malfeasance (Fox and Braxton 1994). However, the universities are reluctant to impose sanctions as severe as the termination of the appointment of an offending individual because the value they attach to maintaining institutional resources and reputation conflicts with ethical standards for research performance (Fox and Braxton 1994). If strong sanctions are meted out, resources and reputation may be lost.
Moreover, universities depend on individual academics to report wrongdoing. Some observers contend that individual scientists have the ultimate responsibility for taking action for misconduct and are concerned that this responsibility is not being exercised. Chubin notes "the silent suspicions of 'peers' regarding violations of scientific norms which are undocumented and asks why they do not speak out" (1983, 187). When action is taken, it is generally informal and decentralized (Black 1976; Zuckerman 1977, 1988). Thus reliable social control is not being exercised by individual academic professionals. What accounts for the social control of scientific malfeasance by individual academics? The power theory perspective on professional self-regulation, in relation to the norms of professional etiquette, provides a theoretical framework for pursuit of this fundamental question.
Power Theory and Professional Etiquette
Freidson (1970) holds that legitimate, organized autonomy is the fundamental trait of professionalism. Such self-regulative autonomy is granted to an occupational group by societal elites through political negotiation and persuasion. Although professional autonomy is legitimated by such occupational attributes as long periods of training, codes of ethics, and the nature of the work performed, these attributes are not the fundamental traits of

professionalism (Freidson 1970). Instead, an occupation comes to exhibit such attributes as a consequence of political negotiation and persuasion.
A profession is granted autonomy by societal elites with the expectation that it will regulate or control the performance of individual professionals without lay interference (Freidson 1970). However, professional self-regulation of individual performance is constrained by the rules of professional etiquette (Freidson 1975), which are more important than professional self-regulation because they govern the relationships among colleagues when professional misconduct is detected. Professional etiquette prescribes that a colleague should not be criticized either in public or in private by another colleague. Only cautious and tactful language should be used when addressing an offending colleague, and colleagues should endeavor to avoid damaging the reputation and careers of offending individuals or their associated peers, labs, departments, and institutions.
Professionals, including scientists, tend to regard themselves as members of a unique and privileged category of occupations (Dibble 1973; Freidson 1975). As members of the profession, they insist that their colleagues are worthy of respect, trust, and protection.
Inasmuch as these rules of etiquette may be more important than professional self-regulation, consensus about them is a manifestation of colleague solidarity and allows the profession to function like a community (Freidson 1975). Solidarity not only protects the profession from lay interference, but also provides each individual professional with a maximum degree of autonomy.
When misconduct is so blatant that it cannot be ignored despite the rules of professional etiquette, criteria areused to decide on the actions to be taken (Freidson 1975). These criteria may be either (1) functional or (2) symbolic. The application of functional criteria entails the assessment of whether a particular action will prevent future occurrences of misconduct. For example, one can then ask whether appealing to the conscience of the guilty individual will actually prevent future misconduct. According to the functional criteria, sanctions for the sole purpose of punishment are to be avoided.
Symbolic criteria (Freidson 1975) pertain to assessments of whether a particular action will be embarrassing to the guilty individuals or to their affiliates. Sanctions such as initiating formal procedures and their public disclosure would meet symbolic criteria. Economic actions could also be regarded as embarrassing and demeaning to the individual.
By extension, individual academic scientists who have taken a formal action against a colleague suspected of misconduct may also be subject to censure by their colleagues because they violate the rules of professional etiquette. They may be labeled or stigmatized by their colleagues as whistle-

blowers (Elliston et al. 1985). This stigmatization results in a diminution of the professional status of these individuals and may, in turn, harm their reputation and chances for acquiring resources necessary for career advancement (Tangney 1987). The following hypotheses are derived from these
considerations:
Hypothesis 1: The greater an individual's agreement with the rules of professional etiquette, the lower the degree of formality of action taken by them for personally known incidents of scientific wrongdoing.
Hypothesis 2: The greater an individual's belief in the application of functional criteria for scientific wrongdoing, the lower the degree of formality of actions taken by the individual for personally known incidents of scientific wrongdoing.
Hypothesis 3: The greater an individual's belief in the application of symbolic criteria for scientific wrongdoing, the lower the degree of formality of actions taken by them for personally known incidents of scientific wrongdoing.
Hypothesis 4: The greater an individual's belief that taking action against a colleague suspected of misconduct will result in being personally stigmatized as a whistleblower, the lower the degree of formality of action taken by the individual for personally known incidents of scientific wrongdoing.
Because little or no research has tested these four hypotheses, the purpose of this research is to to do so (Braxton 1986; Braxton and Bayer 1994). The findings should contribute to our understanding of the process of self-regulation in the academic profession and may help us account for erratic enactment of social control of personally known incidents of scientific malfeasance by academic scientists.
The degree of formality of actions taken is of interest because Black (1976) and Zuckerman (1977, 1988) have indicated that actions taken for scientific wrongdoing are generally informal. Given that various degrees of formality represent a continuum, a focus on degree of formality is an extension of Black and Zuckerman's earlier observations on responses to scientific misconduct.
Method
Data Collection
Biochemists who personally know of incidents of scientific misconduct and who hold tenured appointments at U.S. universities compose the population of inference for this study. To obtain a sample from this population, a systematic sample (every nth listing, or the next listed individual meeting the selection criteria) of 802 biochemists was drawn from the Biochemistry

section of the American Chemical Society's Directory of Graduate Programs (1991). Only faculty holding the rank of associate professor or professor in U.S. universities with chemistry or biochemistry Ph.D. programs were eligible for selection. Only more senior academic research scholars were selected because such individuals are more likely to have considered issues of misconduct and ethics in scientific work and have crystallized views on the subject.
During the winter of 1992, the "National Scientific Conduct Assessment" survey designed by Braxton and Bayer (1994) was mailed to the sample drawn. The survey contains items that operationalize each of the four hypotheses and the three control variables of this study. The survey also included a series of open-ended questions designed to delineate the types of wrongdoing personally known to individuals, the personal or professional relationship to the offending individual, and the action personally taken, if any, for the incident of malfeasance.
A total of 334 surveys was received after mailing an initial survey form, a postcard reminder, and a second-wave mailing of the survey form to prior non-respondents. The resulting response rate was 42 percent. However, many respondents indicated that they had no "personal knowledge of any scientific behavior involving the research process... judged inappropriate." Hence the sample was reduced to ninety-four biochemists who were tenured, full-time senior faculty and who indicated they personally knew of an incident of scientific wrongdoing.1
Mailing wave analyses were conducted to determine whether the obtained sample was representative of thepopulation of tenured academic biochemists who personally knew of incidents of scientific impropriety. These tests indicated that no bias existed on any of this study's independent or dependent variables. Thus the obtained sample appears to be representative of the population of inference.2
Research Design
To test this study's four hypotheses, the research design included four independent variables, three control variables, and one dependent variable. The four independent variables were functional criteria, professional etiquette, symbolic criteria, and whistleblower stigmatization. The operationalization of these variables is shown in Table 1.
The three control variables were as follows: (1) being a department chairperson (a proxy for administrative responsibility for handling allegations of possible misconduct), (2) professional age (a proxy for generational socialization and for opportunity time to be exposed to a misconduct

incident), and (3) professional status (a proxy for scientific productivity and hence perhaps for the level of standards or "sensitivity" toward research misconduct).3 Being a department chair was controlled in this study because handling unsatisfactory faculty performance and unethical behavior are among the responsibilities of the department chairperson (Tucker 1981). Because chairpersons possess formal authority, the degree of formality in their responses to personally known incidents of scientific wrongdoing is likely to differ from those of other faculty.
Professional age also may influence the formality of actions taken and was controlled in this study. This factor may reflect differences in generational socialization regarding the definition of misconduct. It also reflects longer exposure time and thus greater opportunity to detect misconduct. Moreover, academic scientists of advancing professional age may be more likely to take more formal action for an impropriety because their complaints are more likely to be taken seriously than are those of scientists of less advanced professional age (Black 1976). Additionally, the risk in taking more formal action may be smaller for individuals who are in latter stages of their academic
careers.
Professional status may also affect the formality of actions taken for scientific misconduct. Publication productivity is the indicator of profes sional status used in this study because prolific scientists are more likely receive recognition from their colleagues than are their less productive counterparts (Cole and Cole 1967, 1973; O'Rand 1977). Research suggests that the higher the professional status of an individual, the greater the belief in and compliance with ethical principles (Abbott 1983; Carlin 1966; Handler 1967). High professional status tends to increase an individual's visibility which, in turn, elevates the symbolic significance of an individual's professional behavior (Carlin 1966). Individuals having high professional status may thereby be motivated to conduct themselves professionally in a way that is exemplary and beyond reproach (Carlin 1966). Thus the higher the professional status of an individual scientist, the greater the level of formality of actions that might be taken by the individual for any instances of possible observed scientific malfeasance by others.
Formality of actions taken for personally known incidents of scientific impropriety was the dependent variable. This variable was developed using responses to the following open-ended survey question: "What action, if any, did you personally take regarding this incident?" The incident refers to the most severe misconduct incident involving the research process of which the individual has personal knowledge. Descriptions of the behavior involved in such an incident were elicited from respondents through an open-ended survey question.

The variable developed using these categories and their corresponding scale values represents a general measure of actions taken. Put differently, separate measures of formality of action were not developed for either different types of incidents of misconduct or for the nature of the respondent's relationship to the offending individual.S
The means and standard deviations for all control variables and independent variables are shown in Table 2.
Data Analysis
Multiple regression was used to test the four hypotheses of this study. The four hypotheses were simultaneously tested by estimating a single regression equation. Formality of actions taken was regressed on being a department chairperson, professional age, professional status, professional etiquette, functional criteria, symbolic criteria, and whistleblower stigmatization.
Prior to estimating the regression equation, the zero-order correlations among the variables of this study were examined to test for high multicollinearity. Table 3 shows that high multicollinearity is not a problem; the highest zero-order correlation between any two variables is r = .38.

Findings
The formality of actions taken by individual scientists was of a moderate level (mean = 3.20). Thirty percent of academic biochemists who personally knew of severe incidents of misconduct reported taking no action. At the opposite end of the continuum, 3 percent took action resulting in termination of employment. An equally small number (3 percent) professionally boycotted the offending individual. Another 30 percent reported the incident to appropriate officials and committees. Confronting the offending individual (14 percent) was not as frequent as discussing the occurrence of impropriety with colleagues (20 percent).
Table 4 exhibits the summary statistics for the multiple regression equation used to evaluate the results pertaining to the hypotheses. Two of the four hypotheses are supported. Symbolic criteria (beta = .24, p < .01) and whistleblower stigmatization (beta = .19, p < .03) have statistically significant influences on the formality of action taken for an incident of personally known scientific wrongdoing above and beyond the effects of the three control variables and the other two independent variables.6 Thus the more an individual believes that actions taken should neither publicly embarrass nor affect the financial well-being of offending individuals, the more likely he or she is to take informal action. Moreover, the more individuals think that taking action can damage their own academic careers, the less formal is the action they take. However, neither professional etiquette nor functional

criteria have any statistically reliable influence on the formality of action taken for personally known incidents of scientific impropriety.
In addition to the significant influence of symbolic criteria and whistleblower stigmatization, professional status (publication productivity) also approaches statistical significance in exerting the anticipated effect on the formality of action taken. It would appear, as hypothesized, that the greater an individual's professional status (beta = .17, p < .07), the greater may be the degree of formality of the action taken.7 The total variance in formality of action explained by this regression equation is 20 percent.
Limitations
This study has several limitations that temper our findings, conclusions and implications. Taken together, these limitations suggest that this st should be regarded as heuristic. Future research should seek to overcome following limitations:
1. This study is restricted to scientists in one academic discipline. Bec disciplinary differences across a wide range of professional attitudes and behaviors are shown to be profound and extensive (Braxton and Hargens forthcoming), the study should be replicated in other disciplines.
2. The sample consisted only of senior-level faculty members. Professional etiquette, functional criteria, professional age, and being a department chairperson may have wielded an influence on the formality of actions taken had untenured junior faculty been included in this study. Future research

should include both untenured junior and tenured senior faculty. Such research might also be extended to include graduate students in various scientific disciplines.
3. Although a sample size assuring an adequate subjects-to-variables (10:1) ratio for multiple regression was obtained, a more reliable or even different pattern of results may have been obtained with a larger sample size.
4. The hypotheses of this study assume that the attitudes and beliefs represented by professional etiquette, functional criteria, symbolic criteria, and whistleblower stigmatization influenced the formality of actions taken by a scientist who encountered incidents of wrongdoing. However, it is possible that the formality of actions itself affects these four attitudes and beliefs about proper responses to misconduct. Put differently, the attitudes and beliefs found to influence formality of action-sanction criteria and whistleblower stigmatization-can be regarded as post hoc explanations of past behavior. The use of a longitudinal design would help shed light on the directionality of influence.
Discussion
This study provides empirical support for two of the four hypotheses derived from professional power theory. However, the failure of professiona etiquette and functional criteria to wield anticipated influences requires further explanations.
One possibility of explanation derives from the interactionist perspective on deviance. For a behavior to be defined as an impropriety, an individual must view the behavior as a violation of a social norm, must define this perception, and must report it to others. This labeling process is interactive and various circumstances shape it (Rubington and Weinberg 1968). Extending these formulations to scientific misconduct, we could speculate that symbolic criteria and whistleblower stigmatization may affect responses of scientists only after they have labeled a particular behavior as a case of misconduct, whereas the process of defining a behavior as improper may be affected by professional etiquette. In other words, strong adherence to professional etiquette may impede the definition of a given incident as scientific misconduct, but may play little or no role in affecting the actions of individuals once they had defined this behavior as misconduct. Because the prescriptions of professional etiquette are more important than the social control of misconduct (Freidson 1975), an individual who is strongly committed to professional etiquette would be reticent to define behavior as scientific misconduct.

Braxton, Bayer / Research Misconduct 209
Another possible explanation is that professional etiquette exerts an indirect influence on the formality of actions taken. The effect of professional etiquette may be mediated by symbolic criteria given the modest zero-order correlation between them (r = .18, see Table 3). As the rules of professional etiquette dictate that colleagues suspected of wrongdoing should be accorded respect and utmost consideration, a belief in theserules leads to an application of symbolic criteria when one must choose what to do after misconduct
has occurred.
Several explanations can also be invoked to account for the failure of the commitment to functional criteria to exert any statistically reliable effect on the formality of actions taken in cases of misconduct. One explanation is that functional criteria may exert an indirect rather than a direct influence on the formality of actions taken. The moderately high correlation between functional criteria and symbolic criteria (r = .38) suggests this possibility. Put differently, when deciding how to act when encountering wrongdoing, scientists consider jointly functional and symbolic criteria, but decide on the formality of action by relying on symbolic criteria.
Another explanation is that varying degrees of formality of action may not correspond to the types of actions congruent with the application of functional criteria. In other words, discrete categories of action rather than a continuum of different degrees of formality might be more appropriate. Possible categories of action might then include conversations with the offending individual that appeal to the conscience of the individual or a warning to the offending individual that future incidents of misconduct will lead to more formal action.
Another possible explanation common to the failure of both professional etiquette and functional criteria to exert their hypothesized effects is that they both may play a greater role in the deliberations of university scientific misconduct committees than they do in shaping action at the level of the individual academic professional.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest two primary conclusions about the social control of scientific misconduct:
1. The confirmation of two of the four hypotheses provides partial support for Freidson's power theory as an explanation for the enactment of social control by individual academic scientists. Consequently, it can be concluded that social control of scientific wrongdoing by individual academics tends to

210 Science, Technology, & Human Values
be weakened by the self-serving concerns of the professional scientific community and of the individual scientist. Professional self-interest is manifested in the effects of symbolic criteria on individual social control. The application of such criteria serves professional self-interests of dominance, monopoly, and autonomy (Abbott 1988; Freidson 1970), but they do not promote client welfare (the advancement of knowledge) (Freidson 1975). Client welfare is also not being served by individual academics who fear the stigma of being labeled a whistleblower. Only individual professional selfinterest is being served.
2. The strong influence of professional self-interest is counterbalanced by the effects of professional status. Thus, in deciding on a course of action when they encounter scientific misconduct, individual academic scientists tend to experience ambivalence between these countervailing forces of professional self-interest and the obligations of professional status.
Although our data offer some support for the power theory, a more rigorous test of the theory is required. Such a test would simultaneously examine the effects of the endorsement of standards of proper research conduct, the effects of whistleblower stigmatization, and the role of the sanction criteria in decisions concerning the choice of the course of action of individual academics when they encounter misconduct. The endorsement of the norms of proper conduct is emphasized by the functionalist perspective according to which social control of misconduct is enacted so as to attend to the welfare of clients (Goode 1969). Thus a rigorous test of the power theory would be made by simultaneously testing the functionalist theory.
Research addressing the limitations of this study and a simultaneous test of the power and functionalist theories may provide greater insights into the decentralized and unsystematic nature of the scientists' responses to misconduct observed by Black (1976) and Zuckerman (1977,1988) and help explain scientists' inaction noted by Chubin (1983). Such research will not only increase our understanding of the process of self-regulation in the academic profession, but may also suggest how to develop institutional and public policy directed toward the establishment ofmoreuniversalistic standards and responses to scientific wrongdoing.
Notes
1. It should not be extrapolated from these data that ninety-four of 334 affirmative replies represent a scientific misconduct rate of 28 percent. First, it may be that many of the ninety-four are referring to the same event. Second, the question is subjective and addresses behavior that each respondent judged as "inappropriate." Others may judge the behavior or inciden

differently, given that biochemists share no universal, standardized, comprehensive definition of misconduct.
2. This method of determining a sample's representativeness is consistent with procedures suggested by Goode and Hatt (1952) and Leslie (1972). Analyses of variance were conducted for all variables except department chair. The chi-square test of independence was used for this variable given its dichotomous scoring (chair = 1, not a chair = 0). Three mailing waves constituted the groups used for these comparisons: responses to the initial mailing, responses following a postcard reminder, and responses after the second survey mailing.
3. Because research suggests that quality of graduate department and quality of current academic department influences the formality of actions taken for violations of the norm of organized skepticism (Braxton 1991), these variables were considered for inclusion into this study's research design as control variables. However, the zero-order correlation between graduate school quality and formality of action (r = .04, p < .67) and quality of current academic department (r = .03, p < .75) indicate little or no association. Thus the introduction of controls for these two variables is not warranted.
4. Although termination of an offending individual may appear to be an action that only university administrators can execute, respondents did indicate that engagement in termination procedures was an action taken by themselves. Indeed, some respondents may have held appropriate committee, panel, or administrative positions to execute such action.
5. The use of a general measure of formality of action is justified because two variables were constructed: type of misconduct and relationship to offending individual. Statistical tests were conducted to determine the relationship these two variables have with the formality of actions taken. These tests indicate the absence of statistically significant differences on the degree of formality of actions taken across the categories of both of these variables.
To elaborate, type of misconduct was constructed from responses to the open-ended survey question, "Please describe the behavior involved in the most severe misconduct incident involving the research process of which you have personal knowledge." The first incident reported was used to construct this variable. Four categories of misconduct were derived: fraud (e.g., fabricating data to support one's hypotheses, false recording of results, changing empirical data to support one's hypotheses, and selecting only data that supported one's hypotheses), misallocation of authorship (e.g., intentionally failing to cite the published work of others that was pertinent to one's work, and deleting coauthor's name from a manuscript without permission), misuse of resources, and violation of organized skepticism (failing to question one's own published research findings when numerous replications failed to support initial findings). Using these four categories, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. This ANOVA (F(3, 68) = 0.86, p < .47) indicated that the degree of formality of actions taken did not differ across these four categories of types of misconduct in a statistically significant way.
The relationship to the offending individual was developed from responses to the following open-ended question: "What were your personal and professional relationships to the person(s) who acted inappropriately in the incident?" The first incident reported was used to construct this variable. From these responses, three categories of relationships were discerned: colleague, student, and no relationship. An ANOVA using these three categories was executed. No statistically significant differences across these three categories were observed (F(2, 53) = 1.82, p< .17).
6. Because the regression coefficient (beta and b weights) for symbolic criteria and whistleblower stigmatization are in the direction predicted by the corresponding hypothesis, a one-tailed t test was used.
7. Because the regression coefficient (beta and b weights) for publication productivity is in the direction predicted by the corresponding hypothesis, a one-tailed t test was used.
