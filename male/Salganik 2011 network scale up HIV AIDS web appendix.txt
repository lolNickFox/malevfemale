These supporting online materials have 9 sections. Section 1 describes the known population and summation methods of personal network size estimation and how we used the data from our study to decide between them. These personal network size estimates are used in the network scale-up and generalized network scale-up estimates described in Sections 2 and 3. Next, Sections 4 and 5 describe the multiplier and direct estimates, two commonly used alternatives to the network scale-up method. Section 6 considers the possibility of interviewer effects in the network scale-up estimates. Section 7 compares the scale-up based estimates to Brazilian and international benchmarks. Section 8 discusses the definitions used in each of our data sources. Finally, Section 9 provides the exact question text in Portuguese (along with English translations) that were used for the direct estimates.

1 Personal network size estimation

As described previously, the network scale-up and generalized network scale-up methods depend on the

estimated personal network size of respondents. The two methods most appropriate for estimating this from

a survey are the known population method (Killworth et al., 1998) and the summation method (McCarty

et al., 2001), each with its own strengths and weaknesses (Bernard et al., 2010; McCormick et al., 2010).

Because neither of these methods had been used in Brazil before, we were unsure which would perform

better in this context. Therefore, we included both methods in our general population survey. To summarize

our findings, the two estimation methods produced similar results, but the known population method was

empirically demonstrated to produce more accurate scale-up based estimates. For this reason, we only

presented results from the known population method in the main paper.

To estimate personal network size using the known population method, each respondent is asked the

number of people he or she knows in various groups of known size. For example, if a respondent reports

knowing one woman living in Curitiba who was married in the last 12 months, one could combine that

with the fact that there were 9,960 women in Curitiba that were married in the last 12 months to estimate

that the respondent knows about one-ten-thousandth (1/9,960) of all Curitibans. As there are about 1.8

million

Curitibans,

we

would

estimate

that

the

respondent

has

a

network

size

of

180 people. To improve the accuracy of this estimate, we can ask about many groups of known size which

leads to the following estimator (Killworth et al., 1998)

di =

k yik x N k Nk

(1)

where di is the estimated personal network size (i.e., degree) of person i, yik is the number of people in group

k known by person i, Nk is the number of people in group k, and N is number of people in the general

population. In our study, all of these quantities were restricted to people in Curitiba (N = 1, 817, 434). Our

survey used 20 populations of known size such that

Web Figure 1: Mean number known in each of the 20 groups of known size compared to the size of that group. In general, respondents report knowing more people in larger groups (r = 0.86), which suggests that the responses are reasonable.

When analyzing data from the known population method, we follow the standard practice of top coding

all responses at 30 (Zheng et al., 2006; McCormick et al., 2010); this affected less than 1% of survey responses.

is strongly correlated with the size of that group (r = 0.86) (Fig. 1). This provides us some confidence that,

as has been found in other studies (Bernard et al., 2010), respondents in our study were able to answer

these questions in a reasonable manner. Using the responses to questions about these 20 groups and the

estimator described in Equation 1, the mean estimated personal network size in Curitiba is 184 (median:

138). Web Figure 2(a) plots the distribution of estimated personal network sizes (i.e., degrees) and we see

that qualitatively this is similar to degree distributions estimated from previous studies: the data are right

skewed and have a non-zero mode (McCarty et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2006; McCormick et al., 2010).

To estimate personal network size using the summation method, one attempts to creates a set of ex-

haustive and mutually exclusive relationship types (McCarty et al., 2001). For example, through a series of

interviews and focus groups, our study developed 22 relationship types appropriate to the Brazilian context

including immediate family members living in your home, immediate family members living in other homes,

friends from work, acquaintances from work, etc.; a full list in presented in Web Figure 3. From this data

we can estimate personal network size by simply summing the responses of each respondent,

di,sum =

yij

j

(2)

where yij is the number of people that respondent i knows in category j. The mean estimated personal network size in Curitiba using the summation method is 140 (median: 99).

Web Figure 2(a) plots a histogram of the estimated degrees and shows that at the population-level, both

methods produce similar estimates for the distribution of personal network size in Curitiba. Further, at the

individual-level, these two estimates are also highly correlated (r = 0.49) (Fig. 2(b)), a finding similar to

a previous study in the United States (McCarty et al., 2001). While it is reassuring that the two personal

network size estimation methods produce similar results, quantitatively the estimates are different (mean of

184 vs. mean of 140) and this difference would result in target population size estimates that are about 30%

Fortunately, we can make the choice of which personal network size method to use a data-driven decision by leveraging the fact that we asked about 20 populations of known size (Web Table 1). The intuition behind our approach is to see which measurement of personal network size can better predict the size of the 20 groups of known size. We consider two criteria for evaluating these estimates: mean absolute error (M AE) and root mean square error (RM SE) with the difference being that RM SE penalizes larger errors more heavily because errors are squared. That is,

M AEm =

k | (pk,m - pk) | k

(3)

and

RM SEm =

k(pk,m - pk)2 k

(4)

where m is the method of personal network size estimation (e.g., summation method or known population method), k is a population of known size (e.g., man more than 70 years old), pk is the size of group k, and pk,m is the size of group k estimated using m as the method of personal network size estimation. Further, when estimating the size of group k using the known population method, we do not use group k in the personal network size estimation process in order to provide the fairest test. Web Figure 4 shows the estimated sizes of the 20 known groups using both network size estimation techniques. Broadly speaking, the estimates seem reasonable using either personal network size method, but by both criteria--RM SE and M AE--the know population method personal network size estimates are preferred (known population method: M AE = 0.57, RM SE = 0.80; summation method: M AE = 0.70, RM SE = 0.81). For this reason, the results in the main paper are presented using the known population method.
Web Figure 4 also clearly shows one outlier, the largest group of known size: "middle school student in a public school." This pattern of underestimating the size of larger groups has been noted in earlier scale-up studies as well (Killworth et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2006). Further, by noting that the group "middle school students in a private school" is estimated reasonably well (p = 1.0%, p = 0.9%), we concluded that this outlier was the result of the size of the group, not something specific about middle school students.
We conclude by noting that the preceding approach for choosing between different design options, which we believe has not been used previously, is quite general and can be used in many other ways. For example, it could be used to measure which definition of "to know" leads to more accurate estimates, which interviewing protocol leads to more accurate estimates, etc. The fact that these research design decisions can be made based on empirical data rather than educated guesses is a huge advantage of the scale-up method and suggests the possibility of a cumulation of knowledge in this area. If replicated in other studies as well, we believe that the result that the known population method should be preferred to the summation method is one step in this process of gradual and cumulative improvement.

2 Network scale-up estimate

As defined in the main text, the network scale-up estimator is:

p =

i yi i di

(5)

Using the di estimated via the known population method (see Section 1) we estimate

3075 p = = 3.3%
92003

(6)

Thus, we can see that although our sample size was only 500 people, our survey collected information about an estimated 92,000 Curitibans. We caution that these are not necessarily 92,000 distinct people because of the possibility that the personal networks of our respondents overlap. To construct confidence intervals around this estimates, we begin by noting that the standard scale-up confidence interval procedure developed in Killworth et al. (1998) results in an estimated standard error of

p(1 - p)

se(p) =

i di .

Web Figure 4: Validation plots compared the actual size of 20 populations to their estimated size. Estimates made with the known population personal network size are closer to the true values as measured in terms of mean absolute error (M AE) and root mean squared error (RM SE).

However, this approach will underestimate the variance in our case for two reasons. First, the previous result assumes that we have independently sampled i di people (see Killworth et al. (1998) for a derivation), when in fact these i di people are nested within our 500 respondents and are therefore not independent. Second, the previous result assumes simple random sampling, but in our study we had a two-stage cluster sample design. To resolve both of these problems, we used a bootstrap approach (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) where we generated replicate samples by first randomly re-sampling clusters and then re-sampling respondents within clusters. More specifically, let C1, C2, . . . C54 be the set of 54 census tracts in our sample and let r1, r2, . . . rnC be the nC respondents from census tract C. We first resampled 54 census tracts with replacement from the set of 54 census tracts, and then for each census tract, C, in our replicate sample, we resample nC respondents from the set of respondents from census tract C. We generated 10,000 replicate samples using this procedures and used the percentile method to produce an 95% confidence interval of [2.7%, 4.1%].
3 Generalized network scale-up method
The network scale-up estimator described in the previous section makes some implicit assumptions that are widely believed to be incorrect. For that reason Salganik and Feehan (2011) generalize the network scale-up estimator to relax these strong assumptions by introducing two additional components in the estimator and provide a method for estimating these additional components. We briefly review that work here.
One major implicit assumption of the network scale-up method is that people are aware of everything about those that they are connected to. However, this is unlikely to be the case for traits that are stigmatized or illegal (e.g., heavy drug use). In other words, respondents in our survey might be connected to a heavy drug user, but not aware of the heavy drug use. This problem is called "transmission error" in the scaleup literature because information about network ties is not always "transmitted." Generally, transmission error results in the number of people known in the target population (yi in Eq. 5) being too low, yielding underestimates of target population size (Shelley et al., 1995, 2006). A second implicit assumption of the network scale-up method is that the target population, in our case heavy drug users, has the same average personal network size as the general population. Intuitively, we can imagine that if heavy drug users know fewer people on average they will be underrepresented in the set of people that we learn about using the scale-

6

Web Appendix

up method. Or, if heavy drug users tend to know more people than average, they would be overrepresented. Salganik and Feehan (2011) formalize these ideas and show that a new maximum likelihood estimator, which they call the generalized scale-up estimator, becomes:

p=

i i

yi di

*

1 

*

1 

(8)

where  is the estimated information transmission rate and  is the estimated popularity ratio. One can see that if the estimated transmission rate () is 1 and the estimated popularity ratio () is 1, the generalized scale-up estimator reduces to the original scale-up estimator presented in Equation 1 in the main paper.
In our study, we collected the information needed to estimate  and  using a combination of data from the survey of the general population and a survey of the heavy drug users. The procedure to estimate  involves only the survey of heavy drug users and was done using the game of contacts procedure, as described extensively elsewhere (Salganik et al., 2011). When describing this procedure, we follow standard network terminology and refer the respondents as egos and the people connected to them as alters. For a given ego, the game of contacts uses a series of questions about people with specific first names to sample from the set of alters of that ego (McCarty et al., 1997). Then, information is collected about each alter. For example, the ego can be asked "How many people do you know named Osvaldo?" and then for each Osvaldo known, the ego can be asked whether the alter is aware that the ego is in the target population. This procedure can be repeated for many names to generate a large sample of alters. The estimated transmission rate is then:

 =

wi i i
xi i i

(9)

where wi is the number of alters of respondent i that are aware that she is in the target population, xi is the number of alters generated by the game for respondent i, and i is respondent i's probability of selection. Based on our sample of heavy drug users, we estimated  = 0.77, with estimated 95% confidence interval of [0.73, 0.83]. In other words, we estimated that there is about a 75% chance that an alter connected to a heavy drug user in Curitiba will be aware that the given ego is a heavy drug user.
There are a number of possible sources of error in the estimated information transmission rate. Our procedure measures heavy drug users' perceptions of information transmission rates, not objective-truth. While these perceptions may be more important than actual behavior in some cases (Kitts, 2003), we speculate that there will be both systematic and random differences between the two. Random differences are less of a concern because our estimates are about heavy drug users in Curitiba as a group, not any particular individual, and therefore, involve a large amount of averaging. However, we suspect that there may be systematic error as well which could cause more serious problems. For example, ego's reports about alter's knowledge about ego may be inflated because of the "illusion of transparency," which leads people to believe that knowledge about their behavior is widely known (Gilovich et al., 1998). This and other possible sources of error are described in detail elsewhere (Salganik et al., 2011).
To estimate popularity ratio (), we combine information from the sample of heavy drug users with data from the survey of the general population. More specifically, respondents in both surveys were asked how many people they know with eight different names--Pedro, Rosa, Orlando, Lidia, Mario, Cecilia, Osvaldo, and Iracema. By comparing these responses, we can estimate the differential popularity using the following intuition: if we find that members of the target population know, on average, one person named Pedro and members of the general population know, on average, two people named Pedro, then assuming that members of the target population are not especially likely or unlikely to know people named Pedro, we can estimate that members of the target population have 50% smaller networks or that  = 0.5. Averaging over the eight names, we come up with the following estimator:

 = yT yG

(10)

where yT if the average number of people known with those eight names by the people in the target population and yG is the average number of people known with those names in the general population (Salganik and

Web Figure 5: Comparing the mean number people known with each of eight names in the survey of the
general population and the survey of heavy drug users; dotted line represents line of equality. From these data we estimated a popularity ratio () of 0.69. The figure shows that heavy drug users tend to give lower
responses, a pattern that is consistent across names. The three partially overlapping names in the lower left
portion of the figure are Lidia, Cecilia, and Iracema.

Feehan, 2011). In our data, yT = 0.644 and yG = 0.928 resulting in  = 0.69.1 There are a number of possible sources of error in the estimated popularity ratio. First, a portion of the
difference in responses between the two populations could be due to survey mode effects. In the survey of heavy drug users, respondents were required to provide information about each person they knew with a specific name (see the description of the game of contacts above). However, in the general population survey, no additional information was collected about each alter. This difference in data collection procedures could lead respondents in the game of contacts to report fewer alters which would lead to an underestimate of the popularity ratio. Another potential source of error could arise if heavy drug users are more likely to know people by nickname, rather than proper name. This pattern has been reported anecdotally and would also lead to an underestimate of the popularity ratio. A third possible source of error is that our sample of heavy drug users was collected via respondent-driven sampling (Heckathorn, 1997, 2002; Salganik and Heckathorn, 2004) and this sampling method over-samples respondents who are known by many members of the target population (Salganik and Heckathorn, 2004). Therefore, the nature of our sample of heavy drug users could lead to an overestimate of the popularity ratio. A final potential source of error could come from the set of names used (for additional discussion on how the names were selected see Salganik et al. (2011)). If people with the chosen names are more likely to be known by heavy drug users this will lead to an overestimate of the popularity ratio, or likewise, if people with these names are less likely to be known by heavy drug users this would lead to an underestimate of the popularity ratio. However, Web Figure 5 shows that the popularity ratio for each specific name was similar and suggests that our choice of names did not have a strong effect on our findings.
Using the estimated transmission rate () and the estimated popularity ratio () we can construct the generalized scale-up estimate,
1Note that this calculation excludes one outlier from the general population survery who reported knowing 400 people named Pedro, 400 named Rosa, 100 named Orlando, 50 named Lidia, 200 named Mario, 50 named Cecilia, 50 named Osvaldo, and 50 named Iracema. This respondent was deemed to be an outlier for two reasons. First, of the 500 respondents in the scale-up survey, this was the only one who reported knowing more than 30 people with any name and second, the respondent had a summation method estimated degree of 232. If one were to include this outlier, yG = 0.9857 and therefore  = 0.65.

pg =

i yi * 1 * 1 = 3075 * 1.88 = 6.3% i di 0.69 0.77 92003

(11)

To estimate the variance of pg we could linearize Equation (8) using a Taylor series expansion (see Sarndal

et al. (1992)), but these results are likely to be unwieldy and their accuracy would be unclear. Therefore,

we used a bootstrap approach (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) where we generated replicates of the heavy drug

users sample (using the procedure described in Salganik et al. (2011)) and the general population sample

(using the procedure described in Section 2). Then for each pair of replicate samples, we recomputed i yi, i di, , and . This approach preserves any covariance in the estimates that make up pg. Performing the
procedure for 10,000 replicates results in a bootstrap estimated 95% confidence interval of [4.5%, 8.0%]. As

should be expected, the estimated confidence interval of the generalized scale-up estimate is larger than the

which seems reasonable.

Because this is the first time that the generalized network scale-up estimator has been used we cannot

compare its performance to that in previous studies. Further, since we did not estimate the transmission

rate,  , or popularity ratio, , for other groups we cannot apply the generalized scale-up method to any other

groups of unknown size or known size.

4 Multiplier method

Another method for estimating the sizes of hard-to-count populations is the multiplier method (UNAIDS, 2003). This method estimates the size of the target population based on two pieces of information: 1) a count of people in the target population with some specific characteristic and 2) an estimated prevalence of that characteristic in the target population. In our case, we learned that 423 heavy drug users were enrolled in the CAPS drug treatment program in Curitiba in August 2009. We attempted to ensure that the count from CAPS involved unique people (e.g., did not double-count individuals) and matched our study criteria. For example, there are a large number of people in CAPS who are addicted to alcohol. Since these people did not match our study criteria they were not included in the count of 423.
In a study of heavy drug users in Curitiba using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), we estimated that 3.7% of heavy drug users were in a CAPS treatment program (Bastos, 2009). Therefore, our multiplier estimate for the number of heavy drug users is

which yields

423 = 3.7%
Nhdu

(12)

423 Nhdu = 0.037 = 11459 people When converted to be expressed as a proportion of the general population this becomes:

(13)

11459 pm = 1817434 = 0.6%

(14)

To construct a confidence interval around this estimate, we start by constructing a confidence interval

around our estimate that 3.7% of the heavy drug users in Curitiba are in CAPS treatment. The standard

respondent-driven sampling bootstrap procedure (Salganik, 2006) results in a 95% confidence interval of

[0.7%, 7.8%]. Using the endpoints of this interval and Eqs. 13 and 14, we create a 95% confidence interval

of [0.3%, 3.2%] for the prevalence of heavy drug users in Curitiba. This interval is so wide because the

estimated prevalence of treatment in a CAPS program is so low (less than 5%) and that estimate appears in the denominator of Equation (13). This leads to an unstable estimator where a small difference in estimated

prevalence of CAPS treatment among heavy drug users leads to a large difference in the estimated number

of heavy drug users. Note that the confidence interval for pm is asymmetric because the confidence interval for the RDS-estimated proportion of heavy drug users in CAPS treatment is asymmetric and because that

estimate appears in the denominator of Eq. 13.

9

Web Appendix

As wide as the confidence interval is around the multiplier estimate, it probably underestimates the true uncertainty because the procedure used to generate the RDS confidence intervals has been shown to produce intervals that are too small (Goel and Salganik, 2010). Unfortunately, a more accurate RDS confidence interval procedure is not yet known. Another source of uncertainty is the count of heavy drug users in CAPS treatment, but this uncertainty is difficult to assess statistically because it is not caused by sampling. However, we note that errors of, say, 10% in either direction (i.e., true count of 380 or 465) would increase or decrease our multiplier estimate by 10%, which is equivalent to a change of 0.3 percentage points. Finally, as noted in the main text, a potential source of bias in our estimate comes from our estimate of the proportion of heavy drug users in CAPS: 3.7%. If those who are in CAPS treatment are overrepresented in the RDS estimate, then the estimated prevalence of heavy drug users in CAPS treatment will be too high. The consequence of this overestimate, is that we will have an underestimate of the number of heavy drug users in Curitiba.

5 Direct estimation method

The final method used for estimating the number of heavy drug users was direct estimation (UNAIDS, 2003).

This method involves asking a large sample of the general population if they are heavy drug users. While statistically well-grounded, direct estimation is likely to produce an underestimate, because as described in

the main text, heavy drug users are less likely to be included in a standard household-based survey (Caspar,

1992; Zhao et al., 2009) and respondents will probably under-report their drug use in a survey (Fendrich

et al., 1999; Colon et al., 2001; Delaney-Black et al., 2010).

We have two difference sources of data for direct estimates. First, in 2004 the Brazilian Ministry of

Health conducted the PCAP survey which involved a sample of approximately 1,000 people in Curitiba and

asked directly about use of powder cocaine and injected cocaine (Szwarcwald et al., 2005). Three people reported using these drugs frequently; Section 9 has the exactly question text in English and Portuguese and

the response frequencies. From these data, a reasonable estimate for the prevalence of heavy drug users in

the general population is

1+2 pdir,2004 = 1188+1117 = 0.3%.
2

(15)

Without the raw data files from the PCAP, to which we do not have access, we cannot fully account for

the complex sample design when constructing confidence intervals around our estimates. However, we can

approximate the design effect for our estimate by comparing the estimated standard errors in Szwarcwald et al. (2005), which were estimated in a way to account for the complex sample design, to the estimated

standard errors that would have resulted from simple random sampling. Using four estimates presented

in Table 4 of Szwarcwald et al. (2005)--injected cocaine at least once, injected cocaine currently, snorted

cocaine at least once, snorted cocaine currently--we estimated approximate design effects ranging from 1.27

to 2. Therefore, being maximally conservative, we will assume a design effect of 2 for our estimate, which means that we need to inflate the standard error our estimate by 2:

which yields a 95% confidence interval of [0, 0.7%]. Note that the 2004 PCAP may underestimate the rate of heavy drug use because it only asked about cocaine. However, other drugs that were common in 2010 (e.g., crack and ecstasy) were likely uncommon in 2004 (Fonseca et al., 2010).
In 2010 on our general population survey, we asked respondents directly about the use of all illegal drugs other than marijuana; Section 9 has the exact question text in English and Portuguese and the response frequencies. From that data we estimate:

3 pdir,2010 = 500 = 0.6%

(17)

and using the bootstrapping procedure described in Section 2 we estimate a 95% confidence interval of [0%, 1.6%].

6 Interviewer effects
Our network scale-up and generalized network scale-up estimates were substantially higher than those using other methods. One possible explanation for this pattern is that respondents reported knowing more people who were heavy drug users than they actually knew. As mentioned in the main text, we suspected that one source of such a problem could have been interviewers who did not properly carry out our protocol (although we had no evidence that this might have occurred). Specifically we were worried that some interviewers might have changed the somewhat complex question "How many people do you know who live in Curitiba and who have used illegal drugs other than marijuana more than 25 times in the last six months (i.e., average of once a week)?" to the simpler "How many people do you know that use drugs?" Such a change could obviously lead to responses that are too high which would in turn lead us to overestimate the target population size. Therefore, in this section we investigate whether there were interviewer effects on the responses.
Twelve different interviewers took part in the study, but 99% of the interviews were conducted by nine people. Here we explore the effects of these nine interviewers on estimates. Previous work on the network scale-up method has found relatively large interviewer effects on outcomes related to survey logistics--itemlevel missing data, interrupted surveys, and complete refusals--but did not explore the seemingly more important issue of interviewer effects on actual survey responses (Snidero et al., 2009). Web Figure 6 plots the scale-up estimates excluding data from each interviewer. That is, instead of one estimate based on data from nine interviewers, we produce nine estimates, each based on the data from eight interviewers. The resulting estimates range from 3.1% to 3.6%, and since the estimate using all interviewers was 3.3%, we conclude that no one interviewer had a substantial impact on our estimate.

7 Comparison to Brazilian and international benchmarks
7.1 Illicit drug users
In order to better understand the scale-up based estimates, we compared them to Brazilian and international benchmarks. Readers familiar with international estimates of the prevalence of drug users may suspect that our estimate are quite high, but a critical difference is that most studies are of injecting drug users, whereas our study was of heavy drug users, a potentially much larger group that includes non-injectors. As mentioned previously, we choose to study heavy drug users, rather than injecting drug users, because that is the most

11

Web Appendix
appropriate group to study given the current state of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil where injecting drugs is unusual and heavy drug users show high rates of HIV relative to the general population (Malta et al., 2010).
A 2008 study by the Brazilian Ministry of Health estimated that 0.5% of Brazilians nationally between the ages of 15 and 49 injected drugs in 2008 (Ministerio da Saude, 2011). We can express our network scaleup estimated number of heavy drug users to be with respect to Curitibans between the ages of 15 and 49, and we get an estimate of 5.8% (95% confidence interval: 4.7%, 7.1%).2 We also note than an earlier study of heavy drug users in Curitiba estimated that only about 10% of them injected (Bastos, 2009), with others reporting use of ecstasy, cocaine, and crack, a finding that is consistent with the rapid spread of crack in Brazil (Duailibi et al., 2008). Therefore, after the conversions needed for comparison, we would estimate that about 0.58% of Curitibians between 15 and 49 inject drugs currently, an estimate roughly consistent with the previous national-level estimate by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Our generalized network scale-up estimate, when converted to be an estimate of injecting drug user prevalence of Curitibians between 15 and 49 would be 1.1%, above the previous national-level estimate. Thus, our scale-up based estimates are at least consistent with national-level estimates in Brazil although it is clearly difficult to compare them precisely.
Our scale-up based estimates are also roughly consistent with international estimates at the country level summarized in the meta-analyses of Aceijas et al. (2004) and Mathers et al. (2008), but again, precise comparison is difficult. Because the previous meta-analyses present estimates in terms of the population between 15 and 64 years old, we convert our scale-up estimate to that scale and get an estimate of heavy drug use prevalence of 4.7% (95% confidence interval 3.8%, 5.6%)3, which translates to an 0.47% estimated prevalence of injecting drug use among 15- to 64-year olds. This estimate is generally in line with countrylevel estimates found elsewhere in the world, and is similar to the estimated injecting drug use prevalence in Portugal (0.47%) and Slovakia (0.49%) (Mathers et al., 2008). Our generalized scale-up estimate (after suitable conversion) would be about 0.89% which is similar to the estimated prevalence in Italy (0.89%) and Ukraine (1.16%) (Mathers et al., 2008).
Finally, our scale-up based estimates are also roughly consistent with the estimated prevalence of injecting drug use (of 15-64 year olds) in 96 metropolitan areas in the United States (Brady et al., 2008). Our scale-up estimate of 0.47% for Curitiba and our generalized scale-up estimate of 0.89%, are at the lower-to-middle end of the estimates from US metropolitan areas which ranged from 0.37% (of population aged 15-64) in Ann Arbor, MI to 3.36% (of population aged 15-64) for Baltimore, MD. Thus, provided that one adjusts for the difference between heavy drug users and injecting drug users, our scale-up based estimates appear plausible when compared to national-level estimates from Brazil, national-level estimates from other countries, and city-level estimates from other countries. However, we again caution that these comparisons are difficult to do with any precision.
7.2 Female sex workers and men who have sex with men
As mentioned in the main text, the scale-up method allows researchers to estimate the sizes of several target populations in a single data collection. Therefore, our study also estimated the prevalence of female sex workers and men who have sex with men, two other stigmatized groups at risk for HIV/AIDS. Using the scale-up estimator (Eq. 5), we estimate that prevalence of female sex workers in Curitiba is 0.8% (95% confidence interval: 0.6%, 1.1%) (Web Figure 7); note that because we did not have a sample of female sex workers we could not calculate the correction factors needed for the generalized scale-up. A 2008 Brazilian Ministry of Health study produced a national-level estimate of 1.2% prevalence among women between 15 and 49 (Ministerio da Saude, 2011). If we convert our network scale-up estimate for the prevalence of female sex workers to be with respect to women between 15 and 49, we get an estimate of 2.8% (95% confidence interval: 2.0%, 3.8%), which is quite a bit higher than this previous Brazilian estimate. Estimates from other countries in Latin America range from 0.2% to 2.0% (with the exception of Belize which had an estimate of 7.4%) (Vandepitte et al., 2006), again suggesting that our estimate is somewhat higher than
2To convert our estimated prevalence for all of Curitiba to be an estimated prevalence for Curitibans between 15 and 49 we multiply our estimate by the number of people in Curitiba (1,817,434) and divide by the number of people between 15 and 49 (1,045,604).
3To convert our estimated prevalence for all of Curitiba to be an estimated prevalence for Curitibans between 15 and 64 we multiply our estimate by the number of people in Curitiba (1,817,434) and divide by the number of people between 15 and 64 (1,304,987).

previous estimates. Turning to our estimate of men who have sex with men, using the scale-up estimator (Eq. 5), we estimate that prevalence of men who have sex with men is 1.0% (95% confidence interval: 0.8%, 1.3%) (Web Figure 7); note that because we did not have a sample of men who have sex with men we could not calculate the correction factors needed for the generalized scale-up. A 2008 Brazilian Ministry of Health study estimated a prevalence of 3.1% for men between 15 and 49 (Ministerio da Saude, 2011) which is slightly lower than our scale-up estimate converted to this scale: 3.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.9%, 4.5%). International estimates are often presented as a prevalence among men, not men aged 15 to 49, and if we convert to that scale, our estimate becomes 2.1% (95% confidence interval: 1.7%, 2.6%) which is within the ranges found in international meta-analyses although precise comparison is difficult because of definitional ambiguity (Caceres et al., 2006; Baral et al., 2007; Caceres et al., 2008). Thus, our scale-up estimates for these two other target groups are not radically different from national-level estimates in Brazil and are within internationally recognized ranges.
Overall, these comparisons of our estimates to previous Brazilian and international benchmarks do not in any way ensure that the network scale-up estimates are accurate. However, they do provide some sense that the estimates at least plausible.
8 Consistency of data sources
Because we used four different data sources, two of which were collected by other researchers, there were challenges in ensuring the consistency of the target population definition. Our target population was heavy drug users, defined to be people who have used illegal drugs other than marijuana more than 25 times in the past six months.
One data source was a face-to-face survey that was administered to a household-based random sample of 500 adult (i.e., 18 years and older) residents of Curitiba in 2010. This sample was used for the direct estimates in 2010 and the network scale-up and generalized network scale-up estimates. When asking about the respondent's drug use we asked two questions: 1) "Have you used illegal drugs other than marijuana in the past six months?" 2) If yes, we asked: "Have you used illegal drugs, other than marijuana, more than 25 times in the last 6 months (average of once a week)?" The exact question text in Portuguese and response frequencies are presented in Section 9. When asking about how many heavy drug users the respondent knows, we asked, "How many people do you know that live in Curitiba and used illegal drugs other than marijuana more than 25 times in the last 6 months (average of once a week)?"4 Thus the scale-up, generalized scale-up,
4The question text in Portuguese was: "Quantas pessoas voce conhece que vivem em Curitiba que usaram drogas ilicitas, que nao a maconha, mais de 25 vezes nos ultimos 6 meses (media de uma vez por semana)?"
13

Web Appendix
and direct estimate from 2010 all use the same question wording, but the direct estimate is restricted to people 18 years and older while the scale-up based estimates have no age restriction.
A second data source was the respondent-driven sampling study of heavy drug users that was collected between July 28, 2009 and October 18, 2009 (Bastos, 2009). Because it was funded through a different process, that study used a slightly different criteria for screening participants: people 18 and older who have used cocaine, crack, methamphetamines, heroin or hallucinogens at least 25 days in the past 6 month and/or injected drugs at least once in the past six months.5 There were only two respondents out of 303 in this sample who reported injecting drug in the past six months, but did not report using illegal drugs other than marijuana more than 25 times in the past six months. We have removed both of these respondents when estimating transmission rate (see Section 3) and the multiplier estimate (see Section 4). Including these cases does not change the estimates noticeably.
A third source of data were administrative records from the CAPS (Centro de Atencao Psicossocial) drug treatment program in Curitiba. From these administrative records, we believe that 423 people were enrolled in CAPS in August 2009 who met our definition of heavy drug users. This count is supposed to represent unique people (e.g., did not double-count individuals) and excluded people who were not heavy drug users by our definition (e.g., people who were addicted to alcohol).
Our final source of data was the 2004 Brazilian Ministry of Health PCAP survey, which measured the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Brazilian population with respect to HIV/AIDS (Szwarcwald et al., 2005). This study, which was conducted six years before our study, was not designed with our exact target population in mind. However, the survey had two drug use questions that we used for our estimates: "In relation to cocaine powder, you . . ." and "In relation to injecting cocaine, you . . ." with the answers choices being: never used, experimented but don't use any more, use infrequently, and use frequently. The exact question text in Portuguese and response frequencies are presented in Section 9. We considered the respondent a heavy drug user if he or she reported using either drug frequently. Note that the 2004 PCAP may underestimate the rate of heavy drug use because it only asked about cocaine. However, other drugs that were common in 2010 (e.g., crack and ecstasy) were likely uncommon in 2004 (Fonseca et al., 2010). Thus, despite having four different data sources, two of which were collected by other researchers for different purposes, we believe that definitional inconsistency, while it might have created minor differences, is not a major source of problems when comparing our five estimates.
9 Questions used for direct estimates
The questions and responses from the 2004 PCAP in both English and Portuguese are below (Ministerio da Saude, 2005).

In 2010 we directly replicated the questions in 2004 and received similar responses. We also asked respondents directly in a way that matched our definition of heavy drug user.
Q: In relation to cocaine powder, you ["Em relacao a cocaina em po, voce"] n = 500 * never used ["nunca cheirei"], n = 453 * experimented, but don't use any more ["ja experimentei, mas nao uso mais"], n = 42 * use infrequently ["uso de vez em quando"], n = 5 * use frequently ["uso frequentemente"], n = 0
Q: In relation to injecting cocaine, you ["Em relacao a cocaina injetada na veia, voce"], n = 500 * nunca tomei ["never used"], n = 491 * ja experimentei, mas nao uso mais ["experimented, but don't use any more"], n = 8 * uso de vez em quando ["use infrequently"], n = 1 * uso frequentemente ["use frequently"], n = 0
Q: Have you used illegal drugs other than marijuana in the past six months? ["Voce usou qualquer droga ilicita, que nao maconha, nos ultimos 6 meses?"]
* Yes ["Sim"], n = 11 * No ["Nao"], n = 489 If respondents answered yes to the previous question they were asked: Q: Have you used illegal drugs, other than marijuana, more than 25 times in the last 6 months (average of once a week)? ["Voce usou qualquer droga ilicita, que nao maconha, mais de 25 vezes nesse periodo dos ultimos 6 meses (media de uma vez por semana)?"] * Sim ["Yes"], n = 3 * Nao ["No"], n = 8
