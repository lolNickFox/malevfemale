Background: USborn Latinos have higher rates of alcohol use than Latinos who have immigrated to the United States. However, little is known about the preimmigration drinking patterns of Latino immigrants or about the changes in their drinking behaviors in the 2 years postimmigration. Objectives: This article reports findings of a longitudinal study that compared rates of regular, binge, and heavy drinking among a cohort of recent Latino immigrants, ages 18-34, prior to immigration to the United States and in the 2 years postimmigration. Methods: Baseline data were collected on the drinking patterns of 405 Latino immigrants living in the United States for 12 months or less. A followup assessment occurred during their second year in the United States. Results: Findings indicate that number of days of drinking declined significantly postimmigration. Binge alcohol use (five or more drinks on the same occasion during the past 90 days) significantly declined during the postimmigration period. Heavy alcohol use (five or more drinks on the same occasion on five or more days during the past 90 days) also significantly decreased. Conclusions: Results suggest a need for continued exploration of pre immigration drinking patterns and research to uncover underlying factors associated with declines in rates of problematic alcohol use among recent Latino immigrants. Scientific Significance: The results of this study can aid in furthering our understanding of the alcohol use of Latino immigrants ages 18-34 prior to and post immigration to the United States to guide future research and the development of culturally tailored clinical interventions.

concern.3-6 Specifically, binge and heavy drinking episodes of alcohol use affect the physical and emotional wellbeing of adult Latinos in the US.7 Latinos in the US experience
disparate negative consequences resulting from substance use
disorders, including intimate partner violence, incarceration, homelessness, and medical ailments.8 USborn Latinos ages 18-34 exhibit more binge and heavy drinking episodes of alcohol misuse compared to foreignborn Latinos of the same age residing in the US.9 Research has also documented that for
Latinos, patterns of regular and problematic alcohol use increase as length of time living in the US increases.3,10
However, most of the research on the alcohol use patterns of
Latino immigrants has been conducted on samples of Latinos after immigration to the US, lacking the preimmigration information needed to assess drinking behavior changes post immigration.11 Moreover, much of the data collected on the
drinking behaviors of Latino immigrants has occurred years after immigration to the US.12,13 Few studies have included subsamples of the recent immigrant population.12,13 To our
knowledge, no studies have documented drinking trends among young adult recent Latino immigrants in the first 2 years after arrival to the US, nor have any compared Latinos' post immigration alcohol use to their preimmigration patterns. As
previous research on Latino immigrants indicates, Latino immigrants face significant stress resulting from adjustment to
a new culture and lifestyle, which may affect their current and future health status.14,15 Investigating the alcohol use behavior
of recent Latino immigrants, most of whom are relatively
young and thus at high risk for alcohol abuse, prior to and in their first 2 years in the US, may yield important information on the health status of these immigrants given the deleterious
health and social consequences associated with alcohol abuse.16,17 Documenting the alcohol use behaviors of young
adult Latinos will (a) lead to a better understanding of the
alcohol use patterns of recent Latino immigrants residing in the
US in the 2 years after arrival and (b) begin to address a gap in
the literature which suggests that the longer Latino immigrants
reside in the US, the higher their rates of alcohol abuse will be.18 These findings can provide the foundation for the development of more effective culturally tailored alcohol
prevention and treatment programs for recent young adult

immigrants, which can lead to a reduction in their rate of problematic alcohol consumption.
Purpose The primary aim of this article is to document the findings
from a study that investigated whether there are any significant differences in rates of regular, binge, and heavy drinking among a cohort of recent Latino immigrants, ages 18-34, during the 90 days prior to immigrating to the US in comparison with their postimmigration alcohol use in the 24 months after immigration to the US.
Significance The results of this study can aid in furthering our
understanding of the alcohol use of Latino immigrants ages 18-34 prior to and in the 2 years after immigration to the US to guide future research and the development of culturally tailored clinical interventions.

METHODS
Sample Data were collected from 527 Latino immigrants living in
MiamiDade County, FL, at baseline assessment within 12 months after arrival to the US. A followup interview was conducted with 405 of the baseline participants yielding a retention rate of 77%. The study's research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Florida International University (Miami, FL).
The sample consists of 405 cases (51% female; 49% male). In accordance with eligibility criteria, ages at baseline ranged from 18 to 34 years (M age 1/4 26.95, SD 1/4 4.98). Participants included recent immigrants from Cuba (50%), Colombia (19%), Honduras (8%), Nicaragua (7%), and Venezuela (3%) (see Table 1). Participants' average length of time in the US at baseline interview ranged between 1 and 12 months (M 1/4 6.74 months, SD 1/4 3.11). Their length of time in the US ranged between 12 and 25 months (M 1/4 19.95 months, SD 1/4 3.19) at followup assessment. Approximately 77% of the sample had

immigrated with legal documentation and 23% were undocu-
mented. Twentyone percent of participants had college
degrees, 38% had attended some college, 27% had a high
school or equivalent degree, and 14% had not completed high
school. Median total annual income prior to immigration to the
US was $1,200. Participants reported a median total annual
income of $12,000 at followup assessment. More women (87%) were retained at followup assessment
than men [(68.4%), x2 (1, N 1/4 527) 1/4 25.47, p < .001, h2 1/4 .05]. More retained participants were documented (eg,
had legal immigration status) upon arrival to the US (42.5%) in comparison to undocumented participants [(14.3%), x2 (1, N 1/4 527) 1/4 49.86, p < .001, h2 1/4 .10]. Retained participants also reported higher education levels (M 1/4 2.70, SD 1/4 1.02) than nonretained (M 1/4 2.14, SD 1/4 1.07) participants [F(1, 526) 1/4 27.25, p < .001, h2 1/4 .05]. No differences were observed in preimmigration income between retained and nonretained participants. Furthermore, no differences were found for preimmigration regular, binge, or heavy alcohol use between retained and nonretained participants.

Procedures Inclusion criteria for the study consisted of being a Latino,
18-34 years old, who had recently immigrated (ie, within 1 year prior to the baseline assessment) to the US from a Latin American country with the intention of staying in the US at least 2 years beyond baseline. Respondentdriven sampling (RDS) was the primary recruitment strategy. This technique is an effective strategy in recruiting participants from difficultto reach populations.19 Given that approximately 25% of the US Latino population consists of undocumented immigrants20 and that 23% of the present study sample were undocumented
immigrants, RDS was considered to be the most feasible
sampling approach. Each participant (the seed) was asked to refer three individuals in his/her social network who met eligibility criteria. Seeds were recruited via flyers posted in MiamiDade neighborhoods with high populations of Latinos, during Latino health fairs in MiamiDade, and through Latino Community Health Centers. RDS was followed for a
maximum of seven legs for each seed. Interviews were conducted by trained bilingual research
staff. All interviews were conducted in Spanish and completed at a confidential safe location agreed upon by both the interviewer and participant.

Measures Sociodemographic Variables
A demographics form assessed participant gender, age, and country of origin, length of time in the US, education level, documentation status, and pre and postimmigration total annual income.

Alcohol Use
Alcohol consumption prior to and after immigration was
measured retrospectively using the timeline followback interview (TLFB).21 This measure is an assessment tool with

March-April 2013

163

acceptable reliability and validity for various groups of individuals to recall alcohol drinking behavior up to 12 months prior to the interview.21,22 TLFB has been found to provide reliable and valid information on Latino alcohol and drug use, demonstrating high correlations with biological markers and collateral reports.23 TLFB was used to collect Latino immigrants' recall of alcohol use in the 90 days prior to immigration (ie, baseline assessment conducted during participants' first year in the US) and recall of alcohol use after immigration, 90 days prior to followup assessment (conducted approximately 12 months after baseline interview during participants' second year in the US). Alcohol consumption data were collected using a calendar format to provide temporal cues (eg, holidays, special occurrences) to assist in recall of occasions when alcohol was used. Interviewers were trained to spend more time and use additional cues with participants that had to recall drinking patterns beyond the 12month period (22% of the participants were interviewed at baseline between month 10 and 12 after arrival to the US).
Data obtained from TLFB were used to measure: (a) number of drinking days during the 90day pre and postimmigration time periods, (b) number of binge drinking days during the 90 day pre and postimmigration time periods, and (c) engagement in heavy alcohol use during the 90day pre and post immigration time periods. Following SAMHSA definitions: binge alcohol use was defined as consuming five or more drinks on the same occasion at least once during the 90day time period; heavy alcohol use was defined as consuming five or more drinks on the same occasion on 5 or more days during the 90day time period.7
ANALYTIC PLAN
Statistical analyses proceeded in three steps. First, data distributions for number of drinking days and number of binge drinking days variables were assessed to determine if they

violated the assumption of normality. According to Kline,24 continuous variables are not normally distributed enough if they yield absolute skewness and kurtosis values greater than 3.0 and 8.0, respectively. Second, to test for differences between pre and postimmigration number of drinking days and binge drinking days, we used repeated measures analyses of variance (RMANOVA) for each dependent variable (number of drinking days, number of binge drinking days) with the withinsubjects factor of time point and a between subjects factor of gender (due to substance use differences between Latino/a men and women18). Third, to determine differences in engagement in heavy drinking, percentages of participants classified as heavy alcohol users at pre and post immigration time periods were determined for the overall sample, and stratified by gender. A chisquare test for within subjects data (McNemar's chisquare test) was used to determine significant changes in heavy alcohol use category membership across time periods within participants. Comparisons between pre and postimmigration behaviors by gender for number of drinking days and binge drinking days are presented in Table 2 and summarized below.
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses Pre and postimmigration number of drinking days and
binge drinking days were positively skewed. Both variables were transformed using a square root data transformation for subsequent analyses.
Differences between Pre and PostImmigration Number of Drinking Days
RMANOVA determined that mean number of days drinking differed between pre and postimmigration time points [F(1, 403) 1/4 14.03, p < .001, h2 1/4 .03]. A betweensubjects main effect indicated that women reported less drinking days than men [F(1, 403) 1/4 31.42, p < .001, h2 1/4 .07]. However, the

differences between time points on mean number of drinking days did not differ based on gender, as indicated by the nonsignificant interaction effect of withinsubjects (time point) by betweensubjects (gender) [F(1, 403) 1/4 .25, p 1/4 .62, h2 < .01] variables.
Differences between Pre and PostImmigration Number of Binge Drinking Days
RMANOVA also revealed that mean number of binge drinking days differed between pre and postimmigration time points [F(1, 403) 1/4 12.39, p < .001, h2 1/4 .03]. A between subjects main effect indicated that women reported less binge drinking days than men [F(1, 403) 1/4 51.57, p < .001, h2 1/4 .11]. Once again, the differences between time points on mean binge number of drinking days did not depend on gender, as indicated by the nonsignificant interaction effect of withinsubjects (time point) by betweensubjects (gender) [F (1, 403) 1/4 1.72, p 1/4 .19, h2 < .01] variables.
Heavy Alcohol Use Overall rates of heavy alcohol use decreased from pre to
postimmigration. Table 3 provides a summary of differences in the number of participants engaging in pre versus post immigration heavy drinking, as well as results of McNemar's chisquare test of these differences. Thirtynine participants (10%) reported heavy alcohol use only after immigration. More participants (n 1/4 66, 16%) who had engaged in pre immigration heavy use did not engage in postimmigration heavy use. Engagement in heavy alcohol use remained unchanged for 300 (74%) participants.
Men Among men, the percentage of preimmigration heavy
alcohol use declined at a marginally significant rate (p 1/4 .08) after immigration. Twentyeight men (15%) reported heavy alcohol use only after immigration. However, 44 men (22%) avoided heavy alcohol use after immigration, but had indicated heavy use 90 days prior to immigration. Sixtythree percent (n 1/4 125) of men reported no change in behavior.
Women Among women, the percentage of preimmigration heavy
alcohol use also declined at a marginally significant rate (p 1/4 .08) after immigration. Approximately 84% (n 1/4 175) of women reported no change. Eleven women (5%) reported

heavy alcohol use only after immigration. Twentytwo women (11%) did not engage in heavy alcohol use after immigration, but had reported heavy use prior to immigration.
DISCUSSION
These findings indicate that participants (a) drank more often, (b) binge drank more often, and (c) engaged in heavy alcohol use more often during the 90 days before immigrating to the US than during the 90day postimmigration assessment time period. These findings suggest that future studies on alcohol use behavior and its underlying factors among Latino immigrants should account for alcohol use prior to immigrating to the US to obtain a more extensive trajectory of their drinking history. Perhaps because of stressors involved in immigrating, and psychological and cultural factors once in the US,25 problematic alcohol use was higher among the study participants prior to immigration than postimmigration. Study findings indicate that an extensive history of alcohol use trajectories of recent young Latino immigrants may help health providers develop programs to prevent and treat problematic alcohol use for this population.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares Latino immigrant postimmigration alcohol use to pre immigration use irrespective of country of origin. However, nearly all study participants were Latino immigrants from Cuba, Colombia, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, living in Miami, FL, which limits our ability to generalize study results to other Latino subpopulations, primarily persons of Mexican descent. Thus, more research is needed that will document preimmigration versus postimmigration alcohol use among immigrants of Mexican descent and vulnerable Latino subgroups such as migrant workers, day laborers, and undocumented workers. Future research will determine whether the findings reported in this study are unique to Latino immigrants residing in MiamiDade County, or if these findings are indicative of the alcohol use patterns of Latinos in general. Equally important is research that investigates the underlying factors associated with higher frequency rates of alcohol use among Latino immigrants prior to immigration to the US, as well as their decline in use after immigration. Furthermore, this study's findings underscore the importance of indepth exploration of the applicability of the "healthy immigrant effect" to pre and postimmigration alcohol use of

recent Latino immigrants.25,26 The healthy immigrant effect suggests that healthier members of the country of origin may be more likely to immigrate, and that their health declines to match that of many US residents--perhaps because of stressors involved in immigrating and culturally adapting to this country.25
Recommendations for Future Research Epidemiologic Studies
First, preimmigration stressors that Latino immigrants experience during the 90 days prior to immigration should be explored more indepth. It is possible that the decision to immigrate brings about uncertainty and anxiety, effects that may be amplified by the loss of close ties with friends and family, health providers, and religious institutions in one's country of origin,27 which may be related to higher levels of heavy and binge alcohol use reported by participants. These stressors may be further exacerbated among undocumented immigrants, who take on the added risks associated with relocating without proper documentation.28
Second, attention should be given to the psychological factors related to the postimmigration experience of recent Latinos, including the optimistic expectations of many Latino immigrants, derived from beginning a new life in a country with new opportunities.29 The positivity surrounding the start of a new/better life postimmigration may be related to a decrease in health compromising behaviors, such as heavy and binge alcohol use.
Third, factors related to the cultural context of the community in which recent immigrants live shortly after arrival to the US may influence decreases in postimmigration heavy and binge alcohol use. Several studies note that Latinos who immigrate to communities with cultural values that are congruent to their own may face lower stressors when adapting to their new environment.30 These lower levels of stressors may result in better health outcomes, including a reduction of alcohol use among immigrants who live in communities where a majority of their neighbors are Latinos, with even greater effects if the Latino neighbors are from the immigrants' home country. This is the case with the study participants who live in MiamiDade County, where the majority of residents are of Latino descent and where many neighborhoods/cities (eg, Hialeah, Doral, and Sweetwater) are largely composed respectively of Latinos from Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.31
Stringent societal laws in the US, such as the prohibition of drunk driving and penalties for driving while intoxicated (DWI), may also be associated with a reduction in post immigration heavy and binge alcohol use. Seeking to establish a new/better life, recent immigrants may become more aware of existing laws and regulations (ie, traffic laws, neighborhood ordinances) than US born Latinos. This awareness to follow laws and regulations of the host country may be due to recent immigrants' investment in moving to the US, and/or interest in not drawing attention to themselves for alcohol use behaviors, especially if they are undocumented immigrants.

Clinical Implications The findings inform efforts to culturally tailor alcohol use
disorder prevention and treatment services in several ways. Such clinical efforts are needed, in part, because of the increasing numbers of Latino immigrants in the US, in particular, Latino immigrants with alcohol use disorders. First, although there were decreases in binge and heavy drinking behaviors, there were sizable subsamples that continued problematic use at postimmigration. Communitybased models of alcohol use disorder treatment need to continue to be developed and adapted to improve access to clinical services and to reach young Latino immigrants in need of intervention.8 Second, the early years postimmigration may be an important window of opportunity for Latino communitybased clinicians and prevention programs to intervene to help reduce the rates of future binge and heavy alcohol use. Despite commonly cited barriers hindering access to alcohol treatment and prevention services,32 newly arrived Latino immigrant young adults may be receptive to learning about and/or reducing problematic alcohol use and related health risk behaviors.33,34 Furthermore, by considering preimmigration rates of alcohol use and assessing rates after immigration, future clinical research with recent Latino immigrants could determine the underlying social, cultural, and psychological factors associated not only with decreases in problematic use during the initial years in the US, but also with determinants of increased problematic use for some immigrants as they spend more time in the US.10
Limitations This study has several limitations. First, as in all studies
which include retrospective data of prior alcohol use, there may be recall issues given that some of the study participants were asked about alcohol use 90 days prior to immigration. Additionally, drinking behaviors 90 days prior to immigration may not be indicative of participants' typical alcohol use; atypical alcohol use could have occurred in association with departure from country of origin (eg, response to stress of leaving behind family/friends, and farewell celebrations). Second, although respondent driven sampling has been widely successful in recruiting hidden populations such as undocumented immigrants, it does not secure a representative sample. Given the considerable number of undocumented immigrants within the US Latino population,20 RDS was deemed appropriate. Third, the retention rate of the study was 77%. While this retention rate is above the rate (70%) generally accepted as adequate by social and behavioral scientists,35 the loss of 23% of the sample to attrition may have impacted the results. Fourth, a followup assessment of approximately 20 months after immigration may not be a long enough period to establish a pattern of lower heavy and binge alcohol use among participants. Future studies are needed to determine whether, in subsequent years, this pattern of heavy and binge alcohol use could reverse itself and become higher, mirroring the findings of previous research which indicates that the longer Latino immigrants live in the US, the more their patterns of alcohol use become similar to that of USborn

Latinos. Fifth, although efforts were undertaken to include participants from major Latino subethnicities, some groups (eg, Mexican American and Dominicans) were not well represented due to their underrepresentation in the Miami Dade County area.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study is one of the first to provide information on the alcohol consumption behaviors of recent Latino immigrants prior to and up to 2 years after immigrating to the US. These findings are important for future epidemiologic and intervention studies that investigate the patterns and underlying resiliency and risk factors associated with alcohol use, and for the development of more effective culturally relevant alcohol interventions for Latino immigrants. Accounting for preimmigration behaviors may provide a wider time window that will allow researchers to more fully determine the applicability of the healthy immigrant effect theory25,26 as it relates to the alcohol use of Latino immigrants irrespective of country of origin. This future research will not only build and expand on the theories such as the health immigrant effect, but also be of high public significance because it will inform those working with Latino immigrants in the provision of alcohol prevention and treatment services.
